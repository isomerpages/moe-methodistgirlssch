MGS girls are always ready to lend a helping hand when the opportunities present themselves. Ananya Saha of Sec 3G did just that when she helped a member of the public call her daughter whom she got separated from during an evening exercise. The mother had panicked as her phone was with her daughter and the latter did not know her way home, being new to the estate. In her helplessness, the mother reached out to Ananya who immediately used her own phone to try to contact her daughter. Even though night was descending and it was past her own dinnertime, Ananya stayed with the mother all the way till she was finally connected with her daughter. The member of the public was deeply touched by this extraordinary act of kindness and impressed by Ananyaâ€™s calmness and logical thinking to handle the urgent situation.
