<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>At MGS, our Computer Studies curriculum aims to empower students with
critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity; equipping our
students with the resilience and adaptability to navigate the complexities
of tomorrow's technological landscape.</p>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>Computer Studies at MGS is not merely about preparing students for the
future, but empowering them to shape it. We recognise the transformative
power of computing in the fourth industrial revolution. As technology advances
and Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities grow, computing subjects
serve as a gateway for students to explore the frontiers of innovation.
Our Computing program is tailored to nurture talented or passionate students
who may aspire to pursue computing-related studies or careers in the future.
The curriculum prepares our students for diverse fields and careers in
the digital age, by:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developing computational thinking skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fostering a culture of creativity and innovation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instilling principles of digital literacy, cybersecurity, and ethical
behaviour</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through a dynamic and holistic educational experience, we aspire to ignite
a passion for lifelong learning, emboldening our students to embrace uncertainty,
embrace challenges, and seize opportunities as they emerge in the digital
age</p>
<h4>Pedagogy</h4>
<p>Moreover, our curriculum transcends the mere acquisition of technical
skills; it fosters the emerging 21st century competencies such as critical,
adaptive and inventive thinking, as well as collaboration.&nbsp; Through
hands-on projects and collaborative endeavours, students are encouraged
to think critically, solve complex problems, and unleash their imagination
to devise innovative solutions to real-world challenges.</p>
<h4>Curriculum Framework</h4>
<p>The design of our Computer Studies is guided by the MOE Computing Curriculum
Framework which was revised in 2017.</p>

<h3>Computer Studies for Lower Secondary</h3>
<p>Computer Studies lessons for each lower secondary class will be conducted
once every fortnight, with each session lasting 1 hour and 50 minutes.
All students will have attained proficiency in utilizing the Python programming
language to develop interactive games. While Computer Studies for lower
secondary levels is a non-examinable subject, students will undergo assessment
based on their assignments and projects, allowing for holistic evaluation
of their comprehension and application of concepts.</p>
<h3>Computer Studies for Upper Secondary/IP Years</h3>
<p>The Upper Secondary and IP Year 3 and 4 levels offer Computing as a subject,
providing students with the opportunity to further enrich and deepen their
understanding in this dynamic field. The Computing syllabus is designed
to equip students with a strong foundation for advanced studies in computing,
while also imparting skills essential for thriving in a rapidly evolving
technological landscape. Moreover, the concepts and skills acquired are
versatile, extending beyond computing-specific domains to apply in various
other fields where computational expertise is indispensable.</p>
<p>Specifically, the syllabus aims to enable students to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Gain comprehensive knowledge and understanding of core computing areas,
encompassing concepts such as logic, algorithms, data analysis, data representation,
and networking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop and proficiently apply computational thinking skills, including
abstraction and decomposition, to tackle real-world problems. This involves
designing, coding, testing, and debugging programs using personal computers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster an appreciation for computing as a dynamic and creative discipline,
fostering awareness of recent advancements and innovations in computer
systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate an understanding of the social, ethical, legal, and economic
implications inherent in computing, encouraging responsible and ethical
decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instill attitudes and 21st-century competencies crucial for success in
computing and beyond, such as inventive thinking, perseverance, collaboration,
effective communication, as well as a commitment to accuracy and thoroughness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Through this holistic approach, the Computing syllabus endeavors to empower
students not only with technical expertise but also with the critical thinking,
creativity, and ethical awareness necessary to navigate and contribute
meaningfully to our increasingly digital society.</p>
