Earlier this year, our Year 2 girls simulated a United Nations session in Global Studies class. They took on the roles of different superheroes on the Avengers team, delegates of big countries like USA, and diplomats of small countries like Singapore as they tried to negotiate the terms of the Sokovia Accords. Listen to their speeches as they argue whether limitations should be placed on the Avengers to prevent them from causing widespread destruction like they have before. Will Tony Stark force Captain America to retire or will Captain America agree to supervision by the United Nations? Enjoy the lesson and leave your thoughts here:Â [https://go.gov.sg/ohgs2022](https://go.gov.sg/ohgs2022)
