<p>In celebration of the 140th anniversary of The Methodist Church in Singapore
(MCS140) and SG60, MGS is blessed to be part of <em>The Healing Nation</em>—a
nationwide movement that encourages acts of kindness, service, and compassion.
Rooted in the promise of Jeremiah 33:6, this initiative calls on all of
us—students, staff, and parents—to play a part in bringing hope and healing
to our communities.</p>
<p>Through <em>Healing Time</em>, our girls are engaging in school-led outreach
and VIA projects, contributing to the islandwide goal of 1.4 million volunteer
hours. Some of our students will also represent MGS at the <em>Healing Nation Concert</em> on
1 November 2025 at The Star Theatre—a celebration of the Methodist community’s
commitment to serve and uplift others.</p>
