</div>
<h4>Values-based education</h4>
<p>The curriculum emphasises developing principled and responsible citizens
who will serve as ethical and civic leaders in society, guided by a robust
moral compass, poised to serve and contribute to community, Singapore and
the world.</p>
<p>Through engagement with complex ethical dilemmas and focus on social-emotional
learning, students develop greater self-awareness, empathy and positive
relationships with others.</p>
<h4>Personalised learning</h4>
<p>Priority is placed on the development of students’ autonomy, initiative
and lifelong learning skills. Metacognition, self-regulation and self-evaluation
is emphasised, empowering students to monitor their progress, reflect on
their learning and adapt flexibly as needed.</p>
<p>Assessment practices are embedded throughout the learning process, with
students defining their own goals, monitoring their progress, and engaging
in feedback with peers and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The curriculum incorporates a talent development framework that recognises
and builds upon students' individual strengths and interests. Students
develop a deep sense of ownership and agency over their learning and are
better equipped to thrive in a rapidly changing and complex world.</p>
<h4>Intercultural exploration</h4>
<p>Students are equipped with the necessary skills and attitudes to effectively
navigate and engage with diverse cultures. Through formalised curriculum
and partnerships with ASEAN schools, students are given opportunities for
a range of learning experiences, such as language acquisition, cultural
immersion, and cross-cultural communication to foster a deep understanding
of cultural norms, values, and beliefs, and to appreciate the richness
and complexity of cultural diversity.</p>
<p>Through the development of empathy, respect, and openness to different
perspectives and experiences, students are prepared to operate in an increasingly
globalised world and contribute to greater equity, inclusion, and understanding
across cultures.</p>
<h4>Communication and Collaboration-centred</h4>
<p>Students are given ample opportunities for collaboration to develop their
ability to manage team dynamics and challenges. Through emphasis on oral
presentations, they build skills and attitudes necessary to effectively
communicate for audience and impact, as well as make meaning for themselves
and with others in a variety of settings. Students are encouraged to develop
their abilities to listen actively, express themselves clearly and persuasively,
and to consider diverse perspectives and needs when communicating with
others.</p>
<p>By developing their abilities to effectively communicate to diverse audiences,
students are empowered to make meaningful contributions to their communities
and to work towards positive social change.</p>
<h4>Disciplinary and interdisciplinary deep learning</h4>
<p>Academic subjects are designed to cultivate authentic and interdisciplinary
applications of knowledge. Critical thinking, problem-solving, and inquiry-based
learning is prioritised, encouraging students to engage with complex ideas
and concepts in a meaningful and rigorous way.</p>
<p>Through a variety of learning experiences such as authentic problem tasks,
case studies, and hands-on activities, students are challenged to develop
a deep understanding of different disciplines, while also building connections
between different areas of knowledge.</p>
<h4>Authentic problem-posing and innovation</h4>
<p>Explicit connections between classroom learning and real-world applications
are made which empower students with relevant and meaningful learning.
Collaboration is a cornerstone of this approach, as students engage with
peers and stakeholders beyond the classroom to deepen their understanding
and enhance their skills and dispositions toward finding tomorrow's solutions
and framing tomorrow's challenges</p>
<p>The curriculum cultivates students' abilities to ask probing questions,
take risks responsibly, learn from mistakes and failures, pursue inquiry
and decision-making skills, enabling them to be active drivers of their
own learning journey.</p>
<p>This student-centered approach values the process of learning and discovery,
fostering a culture of innovation and critical thinking. In this environment,
questions are elevated above answers, and learning is scaffolded to meet
the needs and interests of each individual student.</p>

<h4>Year 1 &amp; 2</h4>
<h4>MGS ASEAN Programme (MAP)</h4>
<p>Through MAP, our Secondary 1 IP students embark on a vibrant exploration
of Southeast Asia’s cultural diversity. They engage in hands-on experiences
with traditional arts, regional cuisines, music, and languages—developing
a deep appreciation for the unique heritage of ASEAN nations. These experiences
nurture cultural sensitivity and build meaningful regional connections.</p>
<p>Selected Year 2 students continue this journey with an overseas learning
experience in a selected ASEAN country. Through immersive visits and exchanges,
they gain insights into the nation’s culture, economy, and governance.
This deepens their understanding of regional cooperation and strengthens
their sense of shared identity.</p>
<p>MAP cultivates cross-cultural awareness and prepares our students to be
active, empathetic contributors in an interconnected ASEAN community.</p>
<h4><br>Global Perspectives &amp; Inquiry (GPI)</h4>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.mgs.moe.edu.sg/secondary/academic/humanities/global-studies/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GPI programme</a> encourages
Year 1 and 2 students to explore global events and issues through engaging
discussions and critical analysis. They examine how culture, history, and
context shape perspectives, developing empathy and a deeper understanding
of complex world challenges.</p>
<p>By considering diverse viewpoints and the interconnectedness of global
issues, students grow into informed, thoughtful global citizens rooted
in Singapore, prepared to navigate an increasingly complex world.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Year 3 &amp; 4</h4>
<h4>Global Studies</h4>
<p>Years 3 and 4 students in our <a href="https://www.mgs.moe.edu.sg/secondary/academic/humanities/global-studies/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Global Studies</a> programme
explore how nations and cultures interconnect through politics, economics,
social movements, and cultural exchange. Students examine real-world case
studies and current affairs to understand global relationships and Singapore’s
place in the world.</p>
<p>They develop analytical skills and global awareness, learning how local
actions can influence global outcomes. The programme prepares them to engage
thoughtfully with international issues and contribute meaningfully to both
Singapore and the global community.</p>
<h4>Philosophy, Thinking and Knowledge (PTK)</h4>
<p>The PTK programme provides our Year 3 &amp; Year 4 students with an exploration
of the foundations of knowledge. It serves to integrate the disparate school
subjects in the curriculum by reflecting on the ways in which knowledge
is constructed in each of them.</p>
<h4>Independent Studies</h4>
<p>Independent Studies equips students with research skills to investigate
an issue in a discipline of their choice. Working in small groups, they
learn to collaborate, gather data, and address their own research questions.
Beyond theory, they explore how to apply their findings to create meaningful
social impact.</p>
<h4>Passion, Exploration, Aspiration, Knowledge (PEAK)</h4>
<p>PEAK empowers students to transform their aspirations into real-world
experiences through self-initiated external attachments. Stepping beyond
the classroom, students explore careers and industries that align with
their interests.</p>
<p>By applying their learning in authentic work settings—whether shadowing
professionals or contributing to industry projects—students gain insights
that go beyond textbooks. These experiences enable them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deepen understanding of chosen fields through practical exposure
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build professional networks and connections
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop confidence in real-world settings
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make informed decisions about future academic and career paths
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PEAK nurtures self-directed learners who pursue their passions with purpose
and resilience.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Year 1 - 4</h4>
<h4>Lead &amp; Serve</h4>
<p>Lead and Serve aims to strengthen connections among Year 1 to Year 4 students
in the Integrated Programme by building a supportive and collaborative
community through service-learning initiatives.</p>
<p>The project encourages students to engage meaningfully with local communities—immersing
themselves in daily life, identifying needs, and understanding challenges
on the ground. By creating spaces for open and respectful dialogue, students
gain valuable insights into real-world issues. In the process, they not
only contribute to community well-being but also develop self-awareness,
empathy, and a deeper appreciation of their role in society.</p>
<h4>Blackmore Academy</h4>
<p>Blackmore Academy offers a platform for students to engage in workshops
that extend learning beyond the classroom. These workshops, offered termly
to students in both SEC and IP tracks, are curated to support the personalisation
of learning and development of new interests, skills, and peer collaboration.</p>
<p>Workshops may be initiated by students or facilitated by teachers and
external instructors. They span a range of areas in four domains: Academic,
Well-being, Life-skills and Future skills.</p>
<p>Students have the opportunity to participate in existing workshops or
propose and lead their own, encouraging initiative and independent learning
within a supportive environment.</p>
