### Encouraging hearts across Singapore at MRT stations

COVID-19 brought pain, hardship and suffering to many in Singapore. To rally the human spirit, MGS rolled out an initiative for students to design uplifting posters to encourage the public to persevere and unite as one Singapore.   

In this current climate of uncertainty and fear with the pandemic raging worldwide, we hope that through the girls’ uplifting messages and artistic gifts, we can bring cheer to commuters as they start or end their day, and remind everyone that we are together in this as one cohesive and resilient nation.

In continuing our mission to be that city on a hill and the salt and light of the world, MGS strives to spread the message that each of us can be compassionate, caring and courageous and rise above fear.

Hence, with this initiative supported by SBS Transit and Singapore Kindness Movement, we are excited to extend our MGSBlessings movement beyond our school to contribute to the commuter experience and inspire them to be empowered to create good stories and goodwill by being that spark.

These posters which bring messages of hope, solidarity and unity to public transport commuters will be displayed at the various MRT stations nationwide in the coming months - a small way in which we seek to uplift Singapore as we rally to overcome COVID-19.
