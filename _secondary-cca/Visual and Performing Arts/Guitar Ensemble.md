<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Myft1jnWgXM" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Guitar Ensemble</a> aims
to enhance the MGS education for its members by providing fulfilling and
enriching experiences through CCA. Guitar Ensemble was established in 2007
to instil passion in young musicians inclined towards playing the guitar.</p>
<p>The CCA grows its members to showcase the MGS values of Godliness, Excellence
and Love. Through practice sessions, members learn new techniques and hone
their skills, as well as strengthen the camaraderie among themselves. The
character of the MGS girl is also honed as she develops meaningful working
relationships and establishes enduring rapport with her fellow CCA members.</p>

<p>In Guitar Ensemble, members enjoy many opportunities to gain new skills
and valuable insights from the events it takes part in. Biennially, the
ensemble participates in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation.
In preparation for its SYF presentation, the CCA organizes Guitar Ensemble
Exchange Programmes with other guitar ensembles from different secondary
schools and higher institutions, to deepen the members’ passion for and
appreciation of the art of guitar-playing.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also overnight camps during the school holidays
and masterclasses, such as one conducted by Mr Touru Kobayashi, a renowned
guitar ensemble instructor from Japan recently, for members to refine their
skills.</p>
