### MGS Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors Programme

Every year, 2 students from every primary 4 to Primary 6 classes will be nominated by their Form Teachers as the Cyber Wellness Ambassadors (CWSA) of their respective classes. As ambassadors, they are expected to promote and raise cyber wellness awareness among their peers. They actively support the school's cyber wellness programme by helping to conduct and create cyber wellness learning resources such as games, puzzles, comics and posters. As part of their training to prepare them for their role, our ambassadors attend workshops conducted by the school's Cyber Wellness Teacher Coordinators.
