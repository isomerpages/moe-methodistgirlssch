As part of the international sisterhood of Girl Guides, the MG Girl Guides have always been proud to contribute to the rich heritage of the Guiding movement in Singapore.

  

In Guiding at MG, Guides are empowered through fun and challenging programmes, and unique experiences, adventures and activities. The CCA offer opportunities for girls to get involved in different communities, equipping them to make a lasting positive impact by helping others.

The Guides also develop a deep sense of confidence and self-assurance, along with vital leadership and life skills – all while learning through fun adventures and making lifelong friendships! 

  

The Guiding programme teaches girls vital life skills – such as personal goal-setting, decision-making and team-building – in a safe and supportive environment. Girl Guides build and strengthen their leadership skills by taking the lead in Unit and Patrol activities, learning to organise events, and teaching each other and younger girls new skills.

  

Guiding also creates many opportunities for girls to understand complex issues confronting the world today – such as cyber safety, anti-bullying and environmental sustainability. More importantly, Guiding provides hands-on activities that equip girls with skills to take action by leading and participating in service projects that make an impact on the community.
