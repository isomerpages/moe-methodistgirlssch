## Overview


In MGS, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integral to the holistic development of our students. Through the various lessons and activities in the CCE Curriculum, we seek to develop a **positive school culture** that nurtures the **future-ready MGS Girl**.   

  

#### (A) A positive school culture in MGS 

*   is supported by a peer support framework
*   is steered by strong teacher-student relationships where students are recognised and affirmed for their positive actions and contributions  
    
*   adopts a Culture of Honour in our interactions with one another
*   recognises that CCE is a shared responsibility where mutual collaboration and sense of ownership are strong among staff and students

  

#### (B) The future-ready MGS girl

*   is anchored in values
*   is hardworking and resilient  
    
*   is equipped with knowledge, skills and attitudes to navigate the unknown future
*   adopts a spirit of continuous learning
*   is a socially responsible citizen, who contributes positively to family and community

  

## Curriculum


The CCE Curriculum is anchored on the school values of Godliness, Excellence and Love. It is delivered through lessons conducted during curriculum time (GEL lessons, Assembly period, Chapel and Daily Devotions), enrichment activities and informal interactions with staff.

  

The topics that are discussed during GEL lessons, our in-house programme that combines aspects of Character and Citizenship Education, and assembly lessons include:

*   Character and Citizenship Education Lessons (customised based on MOE curriculum)
*   Life Skills including personality profiling and study and time management skills
*   Leadership Skills
*   Education and Career Guidance
*   Sexuality Education
*   Cyberwellness 
*   Citizenship Education
*   Values in Action

Lessons and activities in the CCE Curriculum are selected and customised for the MGS girl as she progresses through each phase of her schooling years. They are developmental in nature and revolve around Level Themes:

    <td class="tg-5hwe">The focus is on helping students develop a deeper understanding of themselves as they transit<br>into and navigate through their adolescent years. Students will gain an awareness of their <br>personal strengths, learning styles, work habits as well as develop an understanding of the <br>values that guide the personal decisions that they make. They will learn to take ownership of <br>their lives and be responsible for their actions and also learn to be compassionate towards <br>others, actively reaching out to touch the lives of those in the community.</td>
