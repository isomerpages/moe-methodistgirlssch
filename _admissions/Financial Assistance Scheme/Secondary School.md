<h2>Financial Assistance &amp; Scholarships</h2>
<p>In MGS, we seek to give every girl a meaningful schooling experience and
to help her to MASTER to GROW and to SERVE in every phase of her life.
The school has put in place comprehensive financial assistance schemes
such as the MOE Independent School Bursary (ISB), school-administered scholarships
and bursaries to help students with financial need to reach their full
