The MGS Secondary Handbell Ensemble was established in 1989 with the vision of providing a platform for aspiring musicians to develop their interest in music and nurture their creative talents in the performing arts.  

Through the CCA, members with different musical abilities have the opportunity to create music together. Students gain exposure to music that spans a wide range of genres: sacred hymns, classical pieces, pop songs, Disney or local songs. Through events such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, the biennial MGS Performing Arts Night as well as VIA activities, members build teamwork, self-confidence, self-esteem, resilience, respect and leadership while honing their musical skills.

The Handbell Ensemble participates in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation and MGS Performing Arts Night, a biennial event. The CCA also features in the MGS Festival of Arts, and comes together with other musical groups in the school for combined concerts.

Members have exchanges and collaborate with the community, such as other schools and Volunteer Welfare Organisations (VWOs) for VIA, enriching their learning. Through these opportunities, members are able to perform for and contribute towards meaningful causes to positively impact the lives of others. The Handbell Ensemble challenges members to step out of their comfort zone to grow and realise their potential.

Every year, the Handbell Ensemble offers an accreditation opportunity to all Secondary 1-4 members with the London College of Music (LCM) Handbell Ensemble Level 5 Examination Certification. The examination is designed to encourage students to develop their musical skills within an integrated framework of assessment.
