<h4>Values-based education</h4>
<p>The curriculum emphasises developing principled and responsible citizens
who will serve as ethical and civic leaders in society, guided by a robust
moral compass, poised to serve and contribute to community, Singapore and
the world.</p>
<p>Through engagement with complex ethical dilemmas and focus on social-emotional
learning, students develop greater self-awareness, empathy and positive
relationships with others.</p>
<h4>Personalised learning</h4>
<p>Priority is placed on the development of students’ autonomy, initiative
and lifelong learning skills. Metacognition, self-regulation and self-evaluation
is emphasised, empowering students to monitor their progress, reflect on
their learning and adapt flexibly as needed.</p>
<p>Assessment practices are embedded throughout the learning process, with
students defining their own goals, monitoring their progress, and engaging
in feedback with peers and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The curriculum incorporates a talent development framework that recognises
and builds upon students' individual strengths and interests. Students
develop a deep sense of ownership and agency over their learning and are
better equipped to thrive in a rapidly changing and complex world.</p>
<h4>Intercultural exploration</h4>
<p>Students are equipped with the necessary skills and attitudes to effectively
navigate and engage with diverse cultures. Through formalised curriculum
and partnerships with ASEAN schools, students are given opportunities for
a range of learning experiences, such as language acquisition, cultural
immersion, and cross-cultural communication to foster a deep understanding
of cultural norms, values, and beliefs, and to appreciate the richness
and complexity of cultural diversity.</p>
<p>Through the development of empathy, respect, and openness to different
perspectives and experiences, students are prepared to operate in an increasingly
globalised world and contribute to greater equity, inclusion, and understanding
across cultures.</p>
<h4>Communication and Collaboration-centred</h4>
<p>Students are given ample opportunities for collaboration to develop their
ability to manage team dynamics and challenges. Through emphasis on oral
presentations, they build skills and attitudes necessary to effectively
communicate for audience and impact, as well as make meaning for themselves
and with others in a variety of settings. Students are encouraged to develop
their abilities to listen actively, express themselves clearly and persuasively,
and to consider diverse perspectives and needs when communicating with
others.</p>
<p>By developing their abilities to effectively communicate to diverse audiences,
students are empowered to make meaningful contributions to their communities
and to work towards positive social change.</p>
<h4>Disciplinary and interdisciplinary deep learning</h4>
<p>Academic subjects are designed to cultivate authentic and interdisciplinary
applications of knowledge. Critical thinking, problem-solving, and inquiry-based
learning is prioritised, encouraging students to engage with complex ideas
and concepts in a meaningful and rigorous way.</p>
<p>Through a variety of learning experiences such as authentic problem tasks,
case studies, and hands-on activities, students are challenged to develop
a deep understanding of different disciplines, while also building connections
between different areas of knowledge.</p>
<h4>Authentic problem-posing and innovation</h4>
<p>Explicit connections between classroom learning and real-world applications
are made which empower students with relevant and meaningful learning.
Collaboration is a cornerstone of this approach, as students engage with
peers and stakeholders beyond the classroom to deepen their understanding
and enhance their skills and dispositions toward finding tomorrow's solutions
and framing tomorrow's challenges</p>
<p>The curriculum cultivates students' abilities to ask probing questions,
take risks responsibly, learn from mistakes and failures, pursue inquiry
and decision-making skills, enabling them to be active drivers of their
own learning journey.</p>
<p>This student-centered approach values the process of learning and discovery,
fostering a culture of innovation and critical thinking. In this environment,
questions are elevated above answers, and learning is scaffolded to meet
the needs and interests of each individual student.</p>

<h4>Blackmore Academy</h4>
<p>The Blackmore Academy houses the MGS signature talent development programmes.
Spanning both disciplinary and interdisciplinary experiences, students
benefit from choice of breadth and depth of activities to develop their
interests and passion.</p>
<h4>Independent Studies</h4>
<p>Independent Studies develops our students as academic researchers, with
the skills needed to systematically investigate an issue in a discipline
of their choice. Working in small groups, they learn how to work collaboratively
to collect the data necessary to address their own research question. They
will also explore ways to apply their findings to achieve social impact,
going beyond the merely theoretical to be of service to others.</p>
<h4>Global Perspectives &amp; Inquiry (GPI)</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.mgs.moe.edu.sg/secondary/academic/humanities/global-studies/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GPI programme</a> aims
to enable Year 1 and Year 2 students to acquire knowledge and understanding
of significant events and issues from around the world while seeing that
there are varied perspectives that people have regarding related human
actions and behaviours.</p>
<h4>Global Studies</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.mgs.moe.edu.sg/secondary/academic/humanities/global-studies/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Global Studies</a> at
Year 3 &amp; 4 is a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of political,
economic, social and cultural relationships of the world through the use
of various disciplinary lenses or perspectives. The essential disciplinary
content will also aid students’ understanding of their respective nation’s
(Singapore or otherwise) place within the global community and to prepare
them to be global citizens for an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<h4>Philosophy, Thinking and Knowledge (PTK)</h4>
<p>The PTK programme provides our Year 3 &amp; Year 4 students with an exploration
of the foundations of knowledge. It serves to integrate the disparate school
subjects in the curriculum by reflecting on the ways in which knowledge
is constructed in each of them.</p>
<h4>The MGS ASEAN Programme (MAP)</h4>
<p>The MAP helps students understand and appreciate different cultures in
Southeast Asia. They learn through studying and experiencing language,
art, food, and music and more of the ASEAN countries. It aims to develop
their awareness and respect for the diverse cultures within ASEAN countries.</p>
<h4>Passion, Exploration, Aspiration, Knowledge (PEAK)</h4>
<p>The objectives of PEAK are to encourage students to explore their passion
and gain knowledge in fields they aspire toward through independently organised
external attachments. Through real-world experiences, they deepen their
understanding and forge meaningful connections between theory and practice.
The programme equips students with greater self-awareness, and confidence
to take on complex new challenges.</p>
