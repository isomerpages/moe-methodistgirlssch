MGS aims to strengthen social empathy and civic consciousness through intergenerational Learning (IGL). The IGL learning model in MGS uses a value exchange model (asset-based design) with opportunities for meaningful contributions and personal development for both seniors and youths. It aims to humanise and value each child and each senior as assets and people of worth. 

Seniors and students from all parts of Singapore can choose to volunteer with- and collaborate-with each other to learn and to initiate projects together. We will also want to invite seniors and youths to initiate IGL courses. 

IGL at MGS aims to promote lifelong learning and intergenerational understanding. These are some areas of possible IGL learning for seniors and youths.
