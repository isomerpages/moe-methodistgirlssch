<p>Softball is a team sport that can be characterised as a game of strength,
grit and power. It is a limited-contact sport where every member has a
crucial part to play. The rigorous four-year programme allows players to
advance through different age-group teams, as well as participate in annual
competitions organised by various external partners. In addition to developing
basic sports skills and competencies, the CCA aims to impart the values
of self-discipline, resilience and sportsmanship, all of which are crucial
to ensuring game flow and success.</p>
<p>Students can expect fun yet challenging training sessions which incorporate
both theory and game situations to hone basic softball skills such as throwing,
catching, fielding, pitching, batting and base-running. Given each player’s
unique strengths and talents, every softball player will adopt roles that
best suit their competencies.</p>

<p>Players can also look forward to participating in various events such
as the annual National School Games, friendly matches as well as the highly
anticipated camps. While the intensity and frequency of training sessions
and competitions demand a high level of commitment, they form an integral
part of the team’s journey to their podium target in the National School
Games.</p>
