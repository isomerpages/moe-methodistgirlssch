<h3>Pedagogy</h3>
<p>The syllabus will provide students with a balance of local, regional,
and international history spanning from the 13th to the 20th centuries.
They will be interested to learn how the interplay of events and the people
who shaped and implemented policies could have such a great impact on and
changed the world to what it is today.</p>
<p>Through an inquiry-based learning approach, the course requires students
to think critically, analyse cause and effect, distinguish between fact
and opinion, and view opinions from multiple perspectives. They will have
to make sense of different interpretations of the past, based on substantiated
evidence, derived from a variety of sources such as video clips, newspaper
articles, extracts from books, letters, speeches and statistics. In the
process, students will be trained to be open-minded, perceptive, discerning
and empathetic.</p>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>Through the course, students will conduct a historical investigation (Lower
Secondary), develop arguments, perform authentic tasks including a self-directed
piece of coursework, and oral presentation. These will require them to
gather, organise, present information in a coherent manner, drawing similarities
and differences, develop creative and critical thinking, evaluate and draw
conclusions from the evidence that they gather.</p>
