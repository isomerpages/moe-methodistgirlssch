### Mission Statement

ParentLink (PL) seeks to engage parents in partnership with the school to enrich the school lives of MGS girls.  

### The Role of MGS ParentLink

ParentLink aims to play a part in our daughters’ learning environment in the following areas:  

1.  Adding fun and variety to the school’s calendar of events and creating memorable experiences for the girls through events organised by the PL committee and supported by class representatives and parent volunteers.&nbsp;
2.  Extending assistance to teachers mainly through the class reps; appreciating what would be helpful to teachers and helping source for suitable parents to assist them. &nbsp;
3.  Helping MGS achieve its targets and objectives as and when initiated by the Principal and vice principals. &nbsp;&nbsp;
  

### Structure

All parents in MGS are automatically part of the school’s parent support group. Some parents will come forth as volunteers to help in various activities and administration; a few will offer to be representatives for their daughters’ classes and will be appointed class/level reps. These reps work with a central committee to organise activities and events for the year.
