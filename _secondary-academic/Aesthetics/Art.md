<h3>Aims </h3>
<p>The aims of the MGS Visual Arts Education is aligned to the MOE syllabus
to enable every child to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>enjoy art,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>communicate visually, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make meaning through connecting with society and culture.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>The teaching and learning of Art is grounded on big ideas:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Art helps us to see in new ways</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Art tells stories about our world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Art influences how we live</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>It develops skills and understanding across 4 areas of learning content
- art forms and media, artistic processes, visual qualities and context.
The 4 areas interact and influence each other in dynamic ways and serve
as entry points to making, thinking and talking about art.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To realise the emerging 21st century competencies through Art, lessons
are designed with core learning experiences appropriate for the different
levels, and augmented by 4 elements of deep learning with</p>
<p>1. Pedagogical practices of inquiry-based learning (IBL), e-pedagogy,
collaborative art making and learning and differentiated instruction. These
are enhanced with thinking moves which include Design Thinking, and commonly
used of See, Think, Wonder and Connect, Extend and Challenge which help
students to make meaningful connections to real life and the art world
as they learn and acquire the skills and concepts through analogue and
digital means.</p>
<p>2. Leveraging digital with art tools and techniques to enhance competencies</p>
<p>3. Learning partnerships which cultivate relationships between teacher-student,
student-student and student-world</p>
<p>4. Learning environment which is interactive and builds a culture of learning
within the school community and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
