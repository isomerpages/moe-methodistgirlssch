# Introduction

**FamilyMatters@School** is a school-based programme that offers parents and students easy access to family life education (FLE) programmes and resources. 

Started in 2002, the programme seeks to: 

**a) Equip parents with the skills and knowledge to:**

*   Enrich and strengthen their family life; and 
*   Foster better parent-child understanding and relationship; 

  
**b)  Equip students with:**  

*   Skills to build healthy relationships with their peers and family; and
*   Positive values and attitudes towards family, relationships and life in general

  

Under the **FamilyMatters@School** programme, the Ministry of Social and Family Development is embarking on a 2-year pilot (April 2014 – March 2016) to introduce evidence-based parenting programmes\* to further enhance parent–child relationships. MGS is one of the schools onboard this pilot programme. 

\*Note: This programme is heavily backed by 30 years of research findings.
