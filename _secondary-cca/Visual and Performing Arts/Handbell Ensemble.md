<p>The MGS Secondary Handbell Ensemble was established in 1989 with the vision
of providing a platform for aspiring musicians to develop their interest
in music and nurture their creative talents in the performing arts.</p>
<p>Through the CCA, members with different musical abilities have the opportunity
to create music together. Students gain exposure to music that spans a
wide range of genres: sacred hymns, classical pieces, pop songs, Disney
or local songs. Through events such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)
Arts Presentation, the biennial MGS Performing Arts Night as well as VIA
activities, members build teamwork, self-confidence, self-esteem, resilience,
respect and leadership while honing their musical skills.</p>

<p>The Handbell Ensemble&nbsp;participates in the Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) Arts Presentation and MGS Performing Arts Night, a biennial event.
The CCA also features in the MGS Festival of Arts, and comes together with
other musical groups in the school for combined concerts.</p>
<p>Members have exchanges and collaborate with the community, such as other
schools and Volunteer Welfare Organisations (VWOs) for VIA, enriching their
learning. Through these opportunities, members are able to perform for
and contribute towards meaningful causes to positively impact the lives
of others. The Handbell Ensemble&nbsp;challenges members to step out of
their comfort zone to grow and realise their potential.</p>
<p>Every year, the Handbell Ensemble&nbsp;offers an accreditation opportunity
to all Secondary 1-4 members with the London College of Music (LCM) Handbell
Ensemble Level 5 Examination Certification. The examination is designed
to encourage students to develop their musical skills within an integrated
framework of assessment.</p>
