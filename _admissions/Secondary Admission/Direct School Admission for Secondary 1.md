<p>MGS invites Primary 6 students to participate in the DSA exercise. As
MGS is a dual track school with both the Integrated Programme (IP) and
Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) Programme, our
DSA talent areas are applicable for both tracks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The </em><strong><em>MGS IP is a six-year integrated programme</em></strong><em> that leads to the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme at Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) in Years 5 and 6.</em>
</p>
<p><em>The </em><strong><em>MGS SEC Programme is a four-year programme</em></strong><em> culminating in the Singapore-Cambridge SEC examinations, after which various post-secondary options are available.</em>
