Under the guidance of instructors and teachers, the CCA’s training programmes provide members with the opportunities to grow and discover themselves while honing their skills, and are crafted to improve members’ tennis knowledge and fitness levels with a variety of drills and games. Besides developing the technical aspect of the game, the programme also fosters growth in each member as an individual through self-reflection and team bonding activities.
