of our lives. From artificial intelligence to online shopping, disruptive
technologies are reshaping how we live and work. The recent global events,
such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have only accelerated these changes. Recognizing
the importance of preparing our students to acquire the digital skills
to navigate this digital age and in line with the National Digital Literacy
Programme announced in 2020, we offer a 1:1 Learning Programme to our students.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why 1:1?</strong>

and collaborative learning, develop digital literacies and technological
skills, and use digital tools to create solutions.&nbsp;</p>
