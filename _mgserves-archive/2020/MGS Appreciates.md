MGS Gives Thanks is a student-led activity which saw P4 to P6 class chairpersons leading their entire classes in folding origami hearts to create an A4-sized card with a personalised message to show appreciation for school staff.    

  

Through this project, our Primary girls expressed their gratitude towards school staff who had worked tirelessly to ensure that the school continues to run during the COVID-19 pandemic and circuit-breaker period. The activity also enabled chairpersons to hone their leadership skills through coordinating and communicating with their classmates on this joint endeavour.
