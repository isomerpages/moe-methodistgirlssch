**Learning Device for Sec/Yr One:**   There is no need for parents to purchase their own iPads as this package is centrally procured by MGS. We will inform parents in due time with regard to the specific purchase and payments modes of the device package. Parents/students can look forward to receiving their iPad bundles by Term 2, Week 1 of the year. 

Please refer to these two handbooks for more information about Learning with a Personal Learning Device:
