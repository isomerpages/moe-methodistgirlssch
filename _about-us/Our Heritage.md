## School Crest

<img src="/images/Common/logo-mgs.png" style="width:30%">

The change in the school crest was initiated by the Principal Miss Lau Meau Eng (1957-1972) as the old badge in enamel could only be made in England.

The crest was introduced in 1965, but there is no record of who designed it.

Methodist Girls’ School (MGS) was founded by Miss Sophia Blackmore on 15 August 1887. Supported by the Women’s Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in America, Miss Blackmore, an Australian missionary, came to Singapore with a mission – to provide girls with an education.

Miss Blackmore started the school with nine girls in a shophouse along Short Street,  Their fathers who were Tamil businessmen, donated money and furniture which allowed the rent-free shophouse to become the Tamil Girls’ School, forerunner of Methodist Girls’ School. The school soon attracted other girls and in 1891 it temporarily relocated to Middle Road while a larger building was constructed on the Short Street premises to house 150 students.

10 years later, the first Senior class of four girls sat for and passed the Cambridge Examination. The enrolment at MGS continued to increase steadily, and by 1925 the school had to move to Mount Sophia. Due to the continued increase in numbers, the school moved again in 1992 to its present Blackmore Drive campus.

In 1989, MGS Secondary acquired independent status and thereafter the full school functioned in a single session. In 1997, the Secondary school started the Integrated Programme (IP) leading to the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) at Anglo-Chinese School (Independent). This added pathway alongside the existing O Level programme, has enriched the MGS learning experience and provided different options to the students.

Today, MGS continues to nurture Godly women of Excellence with a heart of Love so that they can make a difference to the community, to Singapore and the world through their continued journey To Master, To Grow and To Serve.

## School Song

With loving hearts and joyous song we sing to M.G.S. <br>
And tell the fame of that fair name for we can do no less. <br>
We hope that we may honour bring, and heaven ever bless <br>
Our school, the fairest in the land, our own dear M.G.S.

Down through the years our memories will keep a loving place <br>
For friendships made and pleasures shared, and lessons learned apace. <br>
For those who worked and gave their best that we might learn to face <br>
The trials of life with faith and hope and nobly run the race.

And now we're proud to raise the shout and sing of M.G.S. <br>
Lift high her banner, one and all, her name we now profess. <br>
In work and play for honours won, today our hearts confess <br>
The debt we owe, the love we hold for our dear M.G.S.


## BLESS THIS SCHOOL

['Bless This School'](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L41AyMuvFF0gVZPPpHLrB5u5OHsI5iIQ/preview)  is a familiar song that reverberates throughout the school campus daily, and distinctively characterises the schooling days of all MGS girls. Refreshed in 2022, it marks the 135th founding anniversary of MGS, and was first performed live at the MGS 135th Founder's Day Service & Graduation Ceremony.

Mama would chide at breakfast time as I pocketed my money for the day.  
You be a good girl now you hear, and always remember that you are to say,  
Good morning to your teachers,  
And be nice to your friends.  
If you ever do wrong (God forbid)  
just make sure that you make amends.

Cos you're a student in a special school  
Where the girls are sweet & heed the golden rule  
So always behave at your very best  
Cos you're Special  
You're in MGS  
You're in MGS!

Eyes are all bleary early morn,  
midnight oil is still just burning in my head  
But a test is coming and I'm thinking of  
The many many times that Mama said,  
Study hard for each subject, just do well all through the year  
And you'll never have to worry  
When report book season is here

Cos you're a student in a special school  
Where the girls study hard and never play the fool  
So aim high, high in every test  
Cos you're special  
You're in MGS  
You're in MGS!

I wake her up though it's only dawn.  
She makes a face and rubs her eyes.  
Then she gives me a grin minus one front tooth  
And a thousand memories arise,  
Of good old days as a teenage girl,  
Of fun-filled hours of happiness.  
And I watch from the gate as she boards the bus,  
Look after her, dear MGS

Cos she's a student in a very special school,  
where the girls study hard, they heed the golden rule,  
And her Mama knows that she's getting all the best,  
In that special school  
That's called MGS  
She's in MGS
