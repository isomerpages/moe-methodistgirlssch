<p>At MGS, we hold firm the key tenets of the MGS education to nurture and
develop girls in their journey of being and becoming Godly women of Excellence
with a heart of Love. MGS aspires to be a purpose-driven values-centred
community, committed to doing education with and not to our girls. Our
desire is for our students to engage and make meaning of the world around
them through continuous mastery and growth that prepares for a life of
learning, leading and serving. As MGLearns, students embrace deep learning
as culture and a way of life through a whole-of-school approach that develops
the whole child, supported by teachers as key learning partners within
a supportive learning ecosystem. MGServes reflects our commitment to serve
the community and, in serving, learn with and from the community. We are
invested in coaching our students to be and become their best selves for
our community, Singapore and the world, each embodying our school motto
To Master, To Grow, To Serve today, for her life journey of tomorrow.</p>
