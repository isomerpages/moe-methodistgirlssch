As part of its commitment to nurturing future-ready learners, the Ministry of Education had announced that all students in Singapore schools will be supported in their learning by the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources and learning tools.   

With the SLS, students will be able to learn better through the use of technology.  Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere, and at their own pace, whether independently or with their peers. Teachers will also be able to use the SLS to complement their classroom teaching, further enriching students’ learning experience.  

It is the vision of the school to develop an ICT-enriched environment which promotes and cultivates excellence in teaching and learning, where creative, critical and independent lifelong learners are nurtured to meet challenges of the future. 

SLS is being rolled out to all schools in phases.  The students in our school will be given their accounts in May 2018. Our teachers will guide your child/ward in activating the SLS account and using the learning platform.  

We look forward to your support as we help our students strengthen their learning through the SLS.
