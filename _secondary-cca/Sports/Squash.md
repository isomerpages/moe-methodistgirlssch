<p>The Squash CCA aims to cultivate in our girls a passion for squash whilst
enabling them to master different skill levels and maximise their highest
potential in the sport. Our programme develops students by helping them
learn and apply squash racket skills, rules and competencies whilst imparting
values of fair play, sportsmanship, teamwork and discipline.</p>
<p>Through weekly training sessions, friendly matches, sparring with coaches
and competing in National School Games, Squash CCA aims to hone the character
of the MGS girl, cultivating resilience, respect and responsibility. The
collective experience of rigorous physical training fosters positive, enduring
memories and develops strong bonds among team members. Members strive for
continual improvement as a cohesive unit as we work towards teaching the
importance of not only fitness and perseverance on court, but also how
friendship, determination and positivity are essential for success in all
endeavours. The mental focus necessary in a match extends to the academic
realm, enhancing concentration and discipline in studies.</p>
<p>Beyond regular training sessions, the CCA seeks to develop its members
holistically through diverse activities. These include workshops and team-building
activities such as Nutrition Talks, Sports Psychology Talks and Amazing
Race Games to strengthen ties between members and foster collaboration.</p>
<p>The MGS Squash experience aims to create wonderful experiences and unforgettable
memories and lessons. Through this journey, we aim to develop our MG girl
to become a woman of excellence with a heart of love.</p>
