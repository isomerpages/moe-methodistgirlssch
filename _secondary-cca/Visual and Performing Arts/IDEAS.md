<p><strong>Motto</strong>&nbsp;: Value All Creation</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>&nbsp;: Inspiring girls to be Creative, Responsible,
Enthusiastic, Ambitious, Tenacious and Enterprising</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>&nbsp;: Expressing through Innovation and Blessing
through Creation</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Kr4scKttbMo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IDEAS (Innovation.Design.Entrepreneurship.Art.for Society)</a> provides
opportunities for students to develop innovative, critical thinking and
entrepreneurial skills through various forms of visual art mediums. Through
a comprehensive and well-rounded programme, community projects, and competitions,
we aim to develop students holistically in areas of leadership, arts appreciation
and various 21st century skills such as collaboration, communication and
creativity.</p>
<p>IDEAS provides a platform for students to showcase their artistic talents
in various art competitions such as the Live-on Design Competition and
YellowRen, with members clinching multiple accolades; as well as community
projects such as the Singapore General Hospital Arts Expression Wall, SOTA
Art Exhibition, PassionArts and Art Lab Programme. The CCA has also contributed
its expertise and skills to many school projects such as props production
for the MGS Musical, the aesthetics for the Art Gallery, and MGS Founder's
Day decor. Members have had the opportunity to hone their entrepreneurial
skills through selling handmade products at public platforms, being involved
in the making of products, merchandise display, pricing, marketing and
selling process.</p>
