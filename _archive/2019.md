### Being a blessing in this season of giving 

As we approach Christmastime, it is heart-warming to see our girls giving back to the community – whether it is handcrafting small notes of encouragement, or sculpting inspired works of art that bring joy and wonder for a good cause. 

As part of the school’s annual Post-a-Blessing initiative earlier this year, the Primary 1.2 students had learnt about the Goh Chok Tong Enable Awardees. Inspired by the awardees’ stories, the girls wrote personal postcards to each awardee to let them know how their resilience in overcoming their challenges had encouraged them.

This touched their recipients and in return, Miss Chen Ziyue, a GCT Enable Potential Awardee sent two copies of her artworks to the school, and Mr Michael Ngu visited the P1.2 class on 3 October to share his life story with the girls. Mr Ngu encouraged them to count their blessings and to continue to give back to the community with hearts of gratitude.

In support of our Secondary school’s partnership with Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) in the “i-Gen (爱捐) Art” - I Generate Ideas, I Generate Love & Care for Others’ collaborative project, all 282 Secondary 2 students worked in small teams utilising design thinking to create art sculptures from recycled materials. 15 creative pieces were presented as tokens of appreciation to donors of the SKH Better Health Fund, which is managed by SingHealth Fund and provides support to patients from SKH who may be in financial need. 

  

The students hope that their Christmas-themed art will bring festive cheer and uplift the patients from SKH. Knowing that they have played a part in this fundraising process has made their efforts worthwhile.

As a school, we look forward to sharing our blessings with others each year!

### Our Friends From Afar
  
From 18 to 20 July, MGS played host to various groups of students and staff from our twinning schools from Taiwan, Hong Kong, India and Korea. After an enthusiastic introduction to their MGS buddies, our visitors attended our morning assembly and were taken on a tour of the campus. They then took part in some classroom activities and had lunch in our school canteen. Everyone was certainly delighted with the holistic experience of life at school in MGS!

Our visitors then headed down to the Society for the Physically Disabled (SPD) for an afternoon of community engagement with the centre’s elderlies. The students from each school readily stepped up to perform some traditional song pieces from their respective countries, much to the merriment of all the seniors. They played some simple but fun games and served afternoon tea to the seniors. It was a meaningful afternoon filled with much joy and laughter!

In the evening, the visitors and their buddies went on an outing to catch the SG Bicentennial Showcase at Fort Canning Park. Through a multimedia sensory experience, they learnt about key moments in Singapore’s 700 years of history. Many of them readily shared that the experience was truly insightful and unique, and they emerged with a better appreciation of our country’s history.

The next day on Friday, 19 July, the visitors joined our school in commemorating Racial Harmony Day (RHD). Each school gamely performed a traditional dance or song item to showcase their culture, amidst raucous applause from our primary and secondary girls.

All in all, it was a real pleasure to host our friends from abroad. Our visitors had great fun and our girls also learnt plenty from their international counterparts. We look forward to organising more of such exchanges with our twinning schools.
