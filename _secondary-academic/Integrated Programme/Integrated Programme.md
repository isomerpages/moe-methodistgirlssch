## Features of the IP Curriculum


### Values-based Education

The curriculum emphasises developing principled and responsible citizens who will serve as ethical and civic leaders in society, guided by a robust moral compass, poised to serve and contribute to community, Singapore and the world. 

Through engagement with complex ethical dilemmas and focus on social-emotional learning, students develop greater self-awareness, empathy and positive relationships with others. 


### Personalised Learning

Priority is placed on the development of students’ autonomy, initiative and lifelong learning skills. Metacognition, self-regulation and self-evaluation is emphasised, empowering students to monitor their progress, reflect on their learning and adapt flexibly as needed. 

Assessment practices are embedded throughout the learning process, with students defining their own goals, monitoring their progress, and engaging in feedback with peers and other stakeholders.

The curriculum incorporates a talent development framework that recognises and builds upon students' individual strengths and interests. Students develop a deep sense of ownership and agency over their learning and are better equipped to thrive in a rapidly changing and complex world.


### Intercultural Exploration

Students are equipped with the necessary skills and attitudes to effectively navigate and engage with diverse cultures. Through formalised curriculum and partnerships with ASEAN schools, students are given opportunities for a range of learning experiences, such as language acquisition, cultural immersion, and cross-cultural communication to foster a deep understanding of cultural norms, values, and beliefs, and to appreciate the richness and complexity of cultural diversity.

Through the development of empathy, respect, and openness to different perspectives and experiences, students are prepared to operate in an increasingly globalised world and contribute to greater equity, inclusion, and understanding across cultures.


### Communication and Collaboration-centred 

Student are given ample opportunities for collaboration to develop their ability to manage team dynamics and challenges. Through emphasis on oral presentations, they build skills and attitudes necessary to effectively communicate for audience and impact, as well as make meaning for themselves and with others in a variety of settings. Students are encouraged to develop their abilities to listen actively, express themselves clearly and persuasively, and to consider diverse perspectives and needs when communicating with others.

By developing their abilities to effectively communicate to diverse audiences, students are empowered to make meaningful contributions to their communities and to work towards positive social change.


### Disciplinary and interdisciplinary deep learning

Academic subjects are designed to cultivate authentic and interdisciplinary applications of knowledge. Critical thinking, problem-solving, and inquiry-based learning is prioritised, encouraging students to engage with complex ideas and concepts in a meaningful and rigorous way. 

Through a variety of learning experiences such as coursework, case studies, and hands-on activities, students are challenged to develop a deep understanding of different disciplines, while also building connections between different areas of knowledge.


### Authentic problem-solving and innovation

Explicit connections between classroom learning and real-world applications are made which empower students with relevant and meaningful learning. Collaboration is a cornerstone of this approach, as students engage with peers and stakeholders beyond the classroom to deepen their understanding and enhance their skills and dispositions toward finding tomorrow's solutions and framing tomorrow's challenges

The curriculum cultivates students' abilities to ask probing questions, take risks responsibly, learn from mistakes and failures, pursue inquiry and decision-making skills, enabling them to be active drivers of their own learning journey. 

This student-centered approach values the process of learning and discovery, fostering a culture of innovation and critical thinking. In this environment, questions are elevated above answers, and learning is scaffolded to meet the needs and interests of each individual student.

### Sophia Blackmore TD Academy

The Sophia Blackmore Talent Development Academy houses the MGS signature talent development programmes. Spanning both disciplinary and interdisciplinary experiences, students benefit from choice of breadth and depth of activities to develop their interests and passion. 


### Independent Studies 

Independent Studies develops our students as academic researchers, with the skills needed to systematically investigate an issue in a discipline of their choice. Working in small groups, they learn how to work collaboratively to collect the data necessary to address their own research question. They will also explore ways to apply their findings to achieve social impact, going beyond the merely theoretical to be of service to others.


### Global Perspectives &amp; Inquiry (GPI)

The GPI programme aims to enable Year 1 and Year 2 students to acquire knowledge and understanding of significant events and issues from around the world while seeing that there are varied perspectives that people have regarding related human actions and behaviours.


### Global Studies 

Global Studies at Year 3 &amp; 4 is a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of political, economic, social and cultural relationships of the world through the use of various disciplinary lenses or perspectives. The essential disciplinary content will also aid students’ understanding of their respective nation’s (Singapore or otherwise) place within the global community and to prepare them to be “glocal citizens” for an increasingly interconnected world.


### Philosophy, Thinking and Knowledge (PTK) 

The PTK programme provides our Year 3 &amp; Year 4 students with an exploration of the foundations of knowledge. It serves to integrate the disparate school subjects in the curriculum by reflecting on the ways in which knowledge is constructed in each of them. 


### Exploratory Enrichment Electives (EEE)

The EEE aims to help students develop intercultural understanding and a regional mindset through an exploration of culture through academic and experiential activities. Students will develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of ASEAN cultures through the media of language, art, food and music.


### Passion, Exploration, Aspiration, Knowledge (PEAK)

The objectives of PEAK are to encourage students to explore their passion and gain knowledge in fields they aspire toward through independently organised external attachments. Through real-world experiences, they deepen their understanding and forge meaningful connections between theory and practice. The programme equips students with greater self-awareness, and confidence to take on complex new challenges.
