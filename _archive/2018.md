Our P1s and Sec 1s participated in exciting and new experiences during their first few weeks at MGS. 

The P1 girls learnt about school, got to know their classmates, and made friends with their P5 buddies. The Sec 1s embraced the various activities and Orientation Camp wholeheartedly, and were each presented with their very own inaugural MGS Passport. 

We welcome them to the MGS family and look forward to seeing them Master, Grow and Serve.
