<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Myft1jnWgXM" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Guitar Ensemble</a> aims
to enhance the MGS education for its members by providing fulfilling and
enriching experiences through CCA. Guitar Ensemble was established in 2007
to instill passion in young musicians inclined towards playing the guitar.
The Guitar Club was set up in 2022 as a recreational space designed for
students who prefer a relaxed approach to music, and explore the joy of
playing the guitar in learning and playing popular songs, all at their
own pace and comfort level.</p>
<p>The CCA grows its members to showcase the MGS values of Godliness, Excellence
and Love. Through practice sessions, members learn new techniques and hone
their skills, as well as strengthen the camaraderie among themselves. The
character of the MGS girl is also honed as she develops meaningful working
relationships and establishes enduring rapport with her fellow CCA members.</p>

<p>Members enjoy many opportunities to gain new skills and valuable insights
from the events it takes part in to grow in competencies of collaboration,
creativity and communication skills. Biennially, the ensemble participates
in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. In preparation
SYF, the CCA organises Guitar Ensemble Exchange Programmes with other guitar
ensembles from different secondary schools and higher institutions, to
deepen the membersâ€™ passion for and appreciation of the art of guitar-playing.
There are also camps and masterclasses for members to bond together and
refine their guitar skills. At the heart of the MGS Guitar Ensemble is
a passion for creating meaningful connections through music. During the
Festival of Arts in non-SYF years, the ensemble showcases learning experiences
which include intergenerational performances, performing a wide repertoire
of songs that resonate with audiences of all ages. From timeless classics
to contemporary hits, their performances celebrate diversity and unity
through music.</p>
<p>Beyond the stage, the ensemble actively participates in VIA (Values in
Action) projects, using their musical talents to serve the community and
reach out to the under-served. These initiatives provide students with
enriching opportunities to learn, grow, and make a positive impact on the
world around them.</p>
<p>Through music and service, the MGS Guitar Ensemble exemplifies the power
of creativity and compassion, strumming their way to a fulfilling musical
journey.</p>
