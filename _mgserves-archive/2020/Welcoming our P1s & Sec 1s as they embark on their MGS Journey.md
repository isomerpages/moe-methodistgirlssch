2nd January 2020 was the kickstart to the hustle and bustle of another school year. Our newest members of the MG family, the P1s, were warmly welcomed by their P4 buddies as they ventured through the school together. The P1s enjoyed their first days getting to know their teachers and making new friends, all while having fun participating in various activities such as practising to stand in twos at the quadrangle, a trial run before standing with the rest of the school during morning assembly.

  

The P1s also experienced buying their own food in the canteen for the first time, with the help of their new big sisters. They learned how to use their POSB Smart Buddy watches to pay for their meals via the cashless system that the school has introduced. With the flurry of fun-filled activities, it is no wonder that our youngest members were full of energy and excitement for the next big chapter in their lives.

The Sec 1 students were also warmly guided through their first few days of school. They enjoyed two fun-packed days of orientation where they played ice-breakers and formed bonds with their peers. The highlight of their first day was the MGS Passport Ceremony where the students were presented with their very own MGS passport as a rite of passage into their secondary school journey. 

  

On their second day, the students were introduced to an explosion of MG Spirit at the CCA fair. Students from the wide array of MGS CCAs showcased their unique talents in live performances, interactive sports games and even a campfire demonstration right outside the Indoor Sports Hall. The Sec 1s were spoiled for choice as they explored the different teams and clubs they could be a part of for the next four years. To cap off the exciting day, the Sec 1s gathered for a memorable campfire that evening at the quadrangle where they sang, danced and cheered with their orientation groups.

As their MG journey begins, we hope that our P1s and Sec 1s will find solidarity in the MG family, and we are certain that they will embrace the school motto: To Master, To Grow, and To Serve as they blossom into Godly women of Excellence with hearts of Love.
