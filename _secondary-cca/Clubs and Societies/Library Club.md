<p>The MGS Library Club aims to develop student librarians to lead and to
spark the joy in reading amongst their peers. Student librarians plan and
organise book-related activities to develop and sustain the love and appreciation
for a diverse range of literary genres. The MGS Library provides a dynamic
and supportive setting for exploratory learning and the student librarians
manage and maintain it so as to provide a stimulating and conducive environment
for our studentsâ€™ pleasurable learning and innovation. While doing so,
The Library Club also nurtures her members to be passionate and effective
reading ambassadors who are also discriminating users of information and
resourceful knowledge managers.</p>
<p>Through the Library Club activities, student librarians conceptualise,
plan and organise reading-related activities and competitions in school.&nbsp;
Besides the cultivation of the love for reading both fiction and non-fiction,
the Library Club provides many opportunities for students to develop leadership,
teamwork, creativity and communication skills so that they become caring
and confident individuals. Beyond book- related activities, the Library
Club also runs the MakerSpace where members plan and lead engaging workshops
for their peers and the wider community, for example, hosting intergenerational&nbsp;sessions
with seniors, bridging generations through shared curiosity and the joy
of making.&nbsp;</p>
