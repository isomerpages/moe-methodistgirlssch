<p><strong>MGS</strong><em>—</em><strong>WHERE LOVE LIVES</strong>
</p>
<p>This video marks the first intergenerational production by our MGS community—an
original collaboration between students and seniors that celebrates the
quiet, enduring love that binds us as a school. Rooted in God’s love, it&nbsp;follows
simple moments of kindness and connection that&nbsp;ripple through our
daily lives in unseen but powerful ways. This is a portrait of the love
that defines who we are and how we journey together in MGS—a place where
everyone belongs, and where love is not just something we receive, but
something we live out together.</p>
