Softball is one of the two team sports offered in MGS Primary.  The CCA strives to develop in the softball players, an interest and passion in softball through their journey in MGS Primary.  As every child is unique, it is our belief that we develop the strengths of every softball player to build her confidence and self-esteem.  

  

During training, the softball players learn the fundamental skills of throwing, catching, fielding, pitching, batting and base-running.  As softball involves a variety of skills, the softball players will participate in a regime that is progressive and age-appropriate.  In order to hone their softball skills, game situations and friendly matches will be incorporated in the training programme.  In addition, theory lessons will be conducted for the new batch of pupils joining the CCA.

  

Softball is a team sport and every player plays a critical role to ensure the success of the team. Playing a team sport such as softball provides opportunities for the softball players to cultivate important values and life skills such as self-discipline, leadership, resilience, cooperation and good sportsmanship.
