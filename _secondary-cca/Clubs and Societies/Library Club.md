<p>The MGS Library Club aims to develop student librarians to lead and to
spark the joy in reading amongst their peers. Student librarians plan and
organise book-related activities to develop and sustain the love and appreciation
for a diverse range of literary genres. The newly revamped MGS Library
provides a dynamic and supportive setting for exploratory learning and
the student librarians manage and maintain it so as to provide a stimulating
and conducive environment for our students’ pleasurable learning and innovation.
While doing so, The Library Club also nurtures her members to be passionate
and effective reading ambassadors who are also discriminating users of
information and resourceful knowledge managers.</p>

<p>Through the Library Club activities, student librarians conceptualise,
plan and organise reading-related activities and competitions in school.&nbsp;
Besides the cultivation of the love for reading both the fiction and non-fiction,
the Library Club provides many opportunities for students to develop leadership,
teamwork, creativity and communication skills so that they become caring
and confident individuals. A yearly event that the Library Club organises
is the selection of teams from both MGS Primary and Secondary students
to participate in the POSB-NLB Kids’ Lit Quiz. MGS teams have always been
placed in the top 10 positions, with the 2016 MGS Secondary School team
representing Singapore in the World Final in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
