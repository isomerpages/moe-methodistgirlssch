<h3>Vision</h3><p>The Aesthetics in MGS aims to help our students to learn in, about and through the arts, enabling them to transform human experience into artistic expression, how to make sense of their own creative expression and that of others. Through a spectrum of programmes, students have the opportunity to develop personality traits such as creativity, expressivity, as well as self-management skills.</p>
