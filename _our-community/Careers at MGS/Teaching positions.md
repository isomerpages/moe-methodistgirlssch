<p>The school motto `To Master, To Grow, To Serveâ€™ sums up the school philosophy.
Emphasis is placed on the mastery of learning what is important in life,
such as intellectual, physical and social skills, and the development of
morally upright, spiritually and emotionally mature persons who are dedicated
to serving the community. The girls are encouraged to develop a spirit
of excellence giving their best in a nurturing environment. The values
of excellence, godliness and love are imparted both formally and informally,
through the culture of the school.</p>
<p>We are pleased to invite trained and experienced teachers to apply to
join the MGS family. MGS Secondary is a dual-track school with the GCE
O-level track and the IP track leading to the International Baccalaureate
Diploma at ACS (Independent). Applicants should enjoy the challenge of
a dynamic educational landscape where teacher professionals take pride
and ownership in designing curriculum to differentiate teaching to meet
the needs of students with different abilities and learning preferences.
We are looking for individuals who are innovative and can provide authentic
learning experiences, engage students through the use of interactive and
digital media, hone critical and creative thinking skills and inspire learning
for 21st Century students. Those with teaching experience in the Gifted
Education Programme or the International Baccalaureate or who have designed
learning experiences in an international context would be considered favourably.
We also welcome applicants who are currently JC teachers.</p>
