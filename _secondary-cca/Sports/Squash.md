The CCA aims to cultivate in our girls a passion for squash and enable them to master different skill levels. Our philosophy is to equip each girl to maximise her highest potential in the sport. The CCA develops students, ranging from beginners to advanced players, to help them to learn and apply squash racket skills, rules and competencies. It seeks to impart values of fair play, sportsmanship, teamwork and discipline.

  

Through CCA activities such as our weekly training sessions, friendly matches, sparring with coaches and competing in National School Games, Squash hones the character of the MGS girl through each training session and match, cultivating in them resilience, respect, and responsibility.

In squash, members strive for continual improvement as a cohesive unit. The sport teaches members the importance of not only fitness and perseverance in the court, but also how friendship, determination and positivity are essential for success in all endeavours. The benefits of squash extend to the academic realm: the mental focus necessary in a match is applicable to academic studies.

  

As a shelter sport, members are able to carry out training sessions in indoor complexes unaffected by weather. The CCA has top awards and championships in the National School Games, and performed well in the annual Salver competition as well as the R league.
