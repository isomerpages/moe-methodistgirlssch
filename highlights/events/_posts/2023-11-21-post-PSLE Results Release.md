Dear Parent/Guardian, 

Thank you for your interest in selecting MGS as one of the Secondary Schools for your daughter. For your information, **please do not purchase any personal learning device for your child's use in school**. There will be a Zoom Parent Engagement session on Wednesday 27 Dec 2023 at 5 pm to share more information about the purchase of your child's school-prescribed Personal Learning Device by HOD ICT Mr Kenneth Soh. Parents will be informed of the Zoom details via Parents Gateway nearer the date. Thank you.
