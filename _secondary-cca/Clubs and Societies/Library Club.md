The MGS Library Club aims to develop student librarians to lead and to spark the joy in reading amongst their peers. Student librarians plan and organise book-related activities to develop and sustain the love and appreciation for a diverse range of literary genres. The newly revamped MGS Library provides a dynamic and supportive setting for exploratory learning and the student librarians manage and maintain it so as to provide a stimulating and conducive environment for our students’ pleasurable learning and innovation. While doing so, The Library Club also nurtures her members to be passionate and effective reading ambassadors who are also discriminating users of information and resourceful knowledge managers.

Through the Library Club activities, student librarians conceptualise, plan and organise reading-related activities and competitions in school.  Besides the cultivation of the love for reading both the fiction and non-fiction, the Library Club provides many opportunities for students to develop leadership, teamwork, creativity and communication skills so that they become caring and confident individuals. A yearly event that the Library Club organises is the selection of teams from both MGS Primary and Secondary students to participate in the POSB-NLB Kids’ Lit Quiz. MGS teams have always been placed in the top 10 positions, with the 2016 MGS Secondary School team representing Singapore in the World Final in Auckland, New Zealand.
