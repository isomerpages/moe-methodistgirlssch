### Aims and Objectives

The Food and Consumer Education (FCE) Programme at MGS aims to equip our students with the knowledge and skills for independent and sustainable living in the 21st century. The lifeskills acquired through the FCE programme will empower them to be good stewards of resources for themselves and community through critical thinking and wise decisions.  
  
Students are provided with various learning opportunities in applying the basic principles of  
(i) Nutrition and Food Management for planning healthy meals and for sustainable food preparation  
(ii) Creative Use of Consumer Textiles and Clothing for sustainable living  
(iii) Consumer Education for making wise and informed choices.
