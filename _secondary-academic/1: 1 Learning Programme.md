<h3>Empowering Tomorrow's Leaders: Our 1:1 Learning Programme</h3>
<p>In today's fast-paced world, technology is revolutionizing every aspect
of our lives. From artificial intelligence to online shopping, disruptive
technologies are reshaping how we live and work. The recent global events,
such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have only accelerated these changes. Recognizing
the importance of preparing our students to acquire the digital skills
to navigate this digital age and in line with the National Digital Literacy
Programme announced in 2020, we offer a 1:1 Learning Programme to our students.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Why 1:1?</h4>
<p>Our commitment to a 1:1 computing initiative is driven by the recognition
that technology is not merely a tool but a powerful enabler and capability
multiplier to enhance and customise students’ learning experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><br>The Aims:</h4>
<p>The primary aim of our 1:1 Learning Programme is to equip our students
with the 21st century competencies of collaboration, critical thinking
and communication, which they need to thrive in the future. Since each
student has their own device, we empower them to engage in self-directed
and collaborative learning, develop digital literacies and technological
skills, and use digital tools to create solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instant Connectivity: With access to their own device, students can connect
to learning resources anytime, anywhere, enabling a seamless learning experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personalized Learning: Our 1:1 computing initiative allows for personalized
learning experiences tailored to each student's needs and interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaboration and Communication: Through digital platforms and tools,
students can collaborate with their peers and communicate with teachers,
fostering a sense of community and engagement.</p>
