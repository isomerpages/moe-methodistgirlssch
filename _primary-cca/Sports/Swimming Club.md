The Swimming Club provides a conducive and fun environment for the students to learn basic swimming skills as well as to challenge the proficient swimmers to master and develop stronger swimming strokes. The programme is based on ability and confidence levels of the students in the water. Learning how to swim also helps to inculcate intrinsic qualities such as discipline, perseverance and social skills as the students interact with one another during the sessions.
