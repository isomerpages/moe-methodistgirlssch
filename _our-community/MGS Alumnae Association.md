## The MGS Alumnae Association

The MGS Alumnae serves as a bridge between the Old Girls and the School. As the Alumnae, we are the custodians of our rich heritage: we encourage one another to strive to be Godly women of excellence with a heart of love, and uphold our motto: To Master, To Grow, To Serve, wherever we are placed and in every phase of our lives.
