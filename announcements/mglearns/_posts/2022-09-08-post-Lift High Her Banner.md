**By Laura Lang (3R, 2022) **

Recently, three of our MGS girls were recognised for their outstanding achievement and service in their student life. The Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence (LKY-ARE) was awarded to Nicole Sim Yan Ying (Class of 2021) for exemplifying qualities articulated in our desired outcomes of education. Additionally, the North West Outstanding All-Rounder (OARS) Award was presented to Phang Zhi Xuan Belle (4S) and Lang Wen Ling Laura (3R) as they were both recognised for giving back to the community and excelling in both academic and non-academic spheres.Â 

*"I am extremely honoured to receive this meaningful award, and am grateful for the many growth opportunities in MG. I thank God for His unending grace, for my supportive friends, and for my loving teachers who always spurred me on to grow, dared me to dream, and gave me courage to fail. I hope that I will continue living for His glory while mastering, growing, and serving!"* ~ Nicole Sim
