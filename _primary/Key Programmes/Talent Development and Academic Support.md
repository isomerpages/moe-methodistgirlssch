Talent Development programmes aim to stretch students with a higher aptitude and interest in a specific subject or domain area. Information on the respective Talent Development programmes that are offered to Primary 4 to 6 students is accessible via the respective subject webpages. 

Academic support aims to help students who require more guidance or customised intervention and attention. This is provided via after-school sessions, on a needs basis. These are targeted interventions to support students who need added help with a specific subject and/or subtopics within a subject. These lessons are not mass supplementary lessons but small-group sessions to provide customised support to students. Students’ subject teachers will identify students who would benefit from such targeted support based on daily work and assessments. Subject teachers will inform parents of the dates, times and focus of the targeted support.
