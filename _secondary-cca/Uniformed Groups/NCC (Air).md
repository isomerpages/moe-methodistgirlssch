<p>MGS NCC (Air) was established with the aim of developing girls with discipline,
leadership and a sense of adventure. Being a relatively new unit started
in 2019, members are encouraged to push beyond their limits and step out
of their comfort zones. NCC (Air) nurtures members to grow in strength,
resilience and courage. Through activities such as weapon technical handling,
individual field craft and aeromodelling, members are developed to embody
the MGS girl with a heart to lead and serve her peers and community at
large.</p>

<p>There is a myriad of activities organised by HQ NCC to enrich the learning
experiences of the NCC cadets. The basic activities include orienteering,
drill proficiency, individual field craft, weapon technical handling, IMT
and live range shooting, as well as Air activities such as aeromodelling,
drone flying and computer simulated spot landing etc.</p>
<p>Students are also expected to perform unit VIA initiatives to serve the
community. HQ NCC organises an annual NCC Air Competition to provide a
chance for all Air units to showcase their efforts and compete against
each other, and the CCA garnered 2nd place in the Chuck Glider Category
in the NCC Air Competition in 2019.</p>
