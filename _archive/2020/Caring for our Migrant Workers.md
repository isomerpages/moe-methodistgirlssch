During the COVID-19 pandemic, our students were empowered to respond to the call to make a difference to contribute to the well-being of migrant workers in their dormitories and community isolation facilities. For example, our Primary 6 student leaders secured funding from the Singapore Strong Fund, and came up with an activity book to uplift the spirits of isolated migrant workers. Both Primary and Secondary students also made beautiful cards with heartfelt messages for migrant workers who were moved to the Nexus International School to express their appreciation for their role in nation-building.Â 

  

We celebrate the hearts of compassion and service that your girls have to reach out to the community and to be that blessing to others.
