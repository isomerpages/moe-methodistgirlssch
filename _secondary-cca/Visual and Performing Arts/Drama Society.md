<p>In Physical Theatre and Film Production, the senior members learn the
elements of physical theatre and how to write a production play script.
The sessions help develop an area of expertise based on studentsâ€™ own interests
and teach them to apply the skills they have learnt.</p>
<p>At the end of every year, Drama Society offers an accreditation opportunity
for all Secondary 1-3 members with the Trinity College London Examinations
as part of our enrichment programme. The examinations are designed to encourage
candidates from all countries and cultures to engage with as wide a variety
of performance activities and materials as possible while developing their
skills within an integrated framework of assessment. They also offer candidates
opportunities to demonstrate performance skills appropriate to their interests
and aspirations.</p>
