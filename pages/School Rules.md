Methodist Girls’ School comprises some 2500 interacting pupils and staff with a collective responsibility for sustaining a vibrant nurturing environment for learning and fellowship. To this end, the [MGS School Rules](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z-vcQ7Qj70nDh_biVhsprwZNXgw_Datu/view?usp=sharing) have been drawn up to spell out some ways for the MGS community to work together to uphold the glorious tradition of the school motto: To Master, To Grow, To Serve.

Please familiarise yourself with the [MGS School Rules](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z-vcQ7Qj70nDh_biVhsprwZNXgw_Datu/view?usp=sharing), and reflect on how you will make your contribution as you “grow in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man” through the rich heritage and nurturing of the MGS community.
