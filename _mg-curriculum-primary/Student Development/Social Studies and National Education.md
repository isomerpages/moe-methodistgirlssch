The Social Studies curriculum helps students to grow in knowledge, develop skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to our society and the world in which we live.

Drawing on aspects of society that are of meaning and interest to the students, Social Studies seeks to ignite students’ curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills and appreciate multiple perspectives.

### Field-based Learning Experiences across Levels

Field-based Learning (FbL) refers to learning that extends beyond the walls of the classroom where students are exposed to authentic real-world settings. It allows students to contextualise their learning experiences, enabling the relational learning of concepts and content. Students can conduct hands-on exploration in a focused area of study, thus engaging them in multi-sensory learning experiences.

As part of engaging students in inquiry-based learning, FbL will also motivate and sustain their interest in the subject matter as students learn to explore the surroundings, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topic being studied.

### Citizenship Education 

The school also promotes Citizenship Education through the infusion of National Education (NE) messages into all subjects and the commemoration of the 4 core NE events - Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day. Citizenship Education encompasses National Education and is anchored in Social Studies in preparing our pupils to be informed, concerned and participative citizens.
