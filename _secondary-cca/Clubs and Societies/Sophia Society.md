<p>Sophia Society aims to nurture creative and confident communicators. Our
philosophy is anchored on the core tenet that each child has the capacity
to excel as an orator, through experience, enrichment and engagement.</p>
<p>The CCA was established to provide girls with opportunities to be a blessing
to the community through service as emcees, hosts, deejays and moderators.
It develops oracy skills and competencies, and imparts values of discipline
and collaboration.</p>

<p>Through activities and programmes such as panel moderation, orating, hosting
and emceeing, as well as community projects which engage members with real-life
issues from Singapore to across the globe, we hone the MGS girl to be an
articulate and effective communicator, anchored in sound values, and well-poised
to respond and contribute to the future landscape.</p>
