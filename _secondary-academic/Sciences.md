<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>MGS science students are logical and adaptive thinkers who are technologically,
scientifically, and mathematically trained to tackle complex questions,
and develop solutions to real world problems.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The MGS Science Curriculum helps guide students to actively engage in
scientific practices and apply concepts to deepen their understanding of
the core ideas in the three sciences.</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to carry out scientific investigations
related to the disciplinary core ideas. This will engage the students with
fundamental questions about the world and how scientists have found answers
to them.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Upon graduation, MGS students would have gained sufficient knowledge of
the core ideas of science and its practices to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>appreciate that science and the current scientific understanding of the
world are the result of many years of human endeavours.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage in adaptive and inventive thinking to develop solutions to complex
problems. be critical consumers of scientific information related to their
everyday lives.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keep learning about science throughout their lives. be prepared for education
beyond MGS and;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>become confident citizens in this technology-rich and scientifically complex
world.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>The MGS Science Curriculum is adapted from MOEâ€™s Science Curriculum Framework
and the Aims of the IB Science Curriculum, which is based on:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>inquiry-based teaching and learning;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>development of cross-cutting concepts and;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mastery of the disciplinary core ideas</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>Our teachers use a range of formative and summative assessment, activities
and tasks to evaluate the deep learning of scientific knowledge and skills.</p>
