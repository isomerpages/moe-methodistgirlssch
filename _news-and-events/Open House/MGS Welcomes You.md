<p>Step into the heart of Methodist Girlsâ€™ School, where learning is dynamic,
friendships are forged, and every girl is empowered to discover her strengths
and grow with purpose. We invite Primary 5 and 6 students to experience
a community who nurtures curiosity, builds character, and encourages a
heart for service - living out our motto, <strong>To Master, To Grow, To Serve.</strong>&nbsp;
Come see how deep learning comes alive through active engagement, meaningful
connections, and a shared commitment to making a difference.</p>
<p>We can't wait to welcome you to Open House 2025 - <strong>Hear it. Feel it. Live it.</strong>
