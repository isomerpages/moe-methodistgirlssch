<p>The various events this year – such as Kizuna 1, SYF Celebrations at Gardens
by the Bay &amp; National Day celebrations – contributed to students' learning
by fostering collaboration, holistic development, and creativity. Through
group performances, such as the Kizuna concert and National Day events,
students gained teamwork skills as they work together in harmony. This
collaboration with peers, conductors, and even seniors enhances their ability
to communicate effectively and appreciate diverse talents within a team.</p>
