<p>The Girls’ Brigade is a uniformed group, founded in 1893 in Dublin, Ireland.
In 1927, The Girls Brigade came to Singapore, forming its 1st Company in
our very own Methodist Girls’ School through an MGS teacher, Mrs Elsie
Lyne. The 1st Singapore Company GB in MGS is unique in how it comprises
girls from Primary Three all the way until Secondary Four, offering many
opportunities for girls to be and have good role models in the CCA.</p>
<p>With its long history as an education-centred and Christian-based CCA,
the Girls’ Brigade guides students, preparing them with useful life skills,
experiences and values that can be applied in real life. This not only
prepares the GB girls for the world but also fosters a sense of responsibility
and community as they work together and learn as a community.</p>

<p>Here are some quotes from our very own GB girls about what they have learnt
in the CCA:</p>

<p>In regular CCA sessions every Wednesday from 3:00pm to 6:00pm, GB girls
get to experience worship/devotions, badgework, recreational activities
and drill practice. The activities held in regular CCA allow GB girls to
gain experience in many different areas, providing a wide range of learning
activities and opportunities in one CCA.</p>

<p>GB offers its members numerous opportunities to acquire and practise servant
leadership. Each student is placed in a committee and contributes to the
planning and running of activities in weekly sessions, camps and even on
a school level. GB girls thus learn both organisational skills, and the
humility to put others before themselves. Other leadership opportunities
include the General Committee positions, Squad Leaders and Committee Heads.</p>
<p>
<br>Many GB girls from MGS have decided to continue their journey by joining
SPARKS, the tertiary programme of GB Singapore, and have come back to serve
by helping with training the current GB girls. This fosters a deep sense
of love and community that goes beyond regular CCA lessons and bonds between
peers.&nbsp;</p>
