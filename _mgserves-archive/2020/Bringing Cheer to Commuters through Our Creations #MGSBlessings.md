If you are taking the MRT, do look out for a striking array of posters along the walls of selected MRT stations along the Downtown Line - King Albert Park, Beauty World, Little India and Bugis!

In a whole-of-school effort, MGS Secondary school students and staff had tapped on their creative juices to design these vibrant posters during the circuit breaker period earlier in the year.
  
With the world plunged into a climate of fear, uncertainty and economic worries resulting from the ongoing pandemic, these MGS posters seek to uplift and unify the nation so that we remain a resilient and cohesive Singapore.

Through the engaging series of public messages by our MGS girls and staff, we are reminded that we are together in this as one people, and that we can be compassionate, caring and enduring as a community.

  

Alongside the eye-catching graphics are messages of courage and kindness that bring cheer to all across the island during this crucial time, when the prolonged fight against COVID-19 has impacted Singaporeansâ€™ well-being and livelihood.

With this initiative that is in collaboration with SBS Transit and Singapore Kindness Movement, MGS is excited to extend our #MGSBlessings movement beyond our school to contribute to the commuter experience and to inspire others to create good stories and goodwill by being that spark. It is our hope that #MGSBlessings continues to empower and enrich lives in the wider community.
