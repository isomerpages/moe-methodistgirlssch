<p>Values in Action in MGS forms an important part in character education. Students are to be nurtured to be good citizens, conscious of their responsibilities to family, society and country.</p><p>The Values in Action (VIA) programme is essential in developing the character of each MGS student. Students will have the opportunities to serve, relate and work with people beyond the school context. The programme enables students to assess the real needs of society and be able to empathise with people around them. Through participating in community work, students also build the commitment to serve and lead the community.</p>
