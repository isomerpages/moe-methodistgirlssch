## Curriculum

The broad goals of the subject were to develop both the cognitive and affective domains. The curriculum provides students with spatial perspective to physical and human phenomena and to equip them with a critical and analytical mind to make connections to the real world.  
  
Specifically, the goals of the curriculum are:  
  

#### Content

*   Develop knowledge and understanding of Earth’s physical features and processes and human phenomena. 
*   Appreciate the interaction between people and environment at local, regional, and global scales.

  

#### Skills and Processes

*   Develop skills in acquiring, communicating and applying geographical knowledge;
*   Develop multiple perspectives and global awareness through the study and management of current issues.
*   Equip students with inquiry skills of gathering and analysing information in order to seek answers to issues affecting our lives

  

#### Values and Attitudes

*   Develop respect and sensitivity towards the attitudes, values, and beliefs of people in different human environments;
*   Become self-directed learners who think critically and are discerning in judgement.
*   Imbibes in students appropriate attitudes and values that ensures the sustainability of our resources, people and planet.

  

#### The theories that underpin our Curriculum Design

The **Understanding by Design (UbD)** framework aims to develop and deepen students’ understanding through design of clear learning goals, and assessments that provide complex, authentic platforms for students to explain, interpret, apply, shift perspective, empathize, and self-assess.

  
The **Parallel Curriculum Model** is a concept-based approach that helps to develop learner potential and challenge advanced learners.  
  
Therefore, the Geography curriculum draws on UbD as a design framework such that a “backward design” to craft the learning goals, assessment, content and skills first, before the design of lesson activities. The Parallel Curriculum Model’s concept-based approach is employed to in articulating the principles and the concepts to help students make meaningful connections within disciplines and/or across disciplines, times and topics.  
  
This curriculum is taught using **Inquiry-based Learning** which promotes student-centred learning where students are actively engaged in constructing geographical knowledge.  
  

## Assessment


#### Assessment Objectives

**(I) Knowledge and understanding**

*   Demonstrate relevant factual knowledge such as geographical facts, concepts, processes, interactions and trends
*   Select, organise and apply concepts, terms and facts learnt

  

**(II) Critical Analysis and Application**

*   Make judgements, recommendations and decisions
*   Comprehend and extract relevant information from geographical data (numerical, diagrammatic, pictorial and graphical forms)
*   Use and apply geographical knowledge and understanding to interpret geographical data
*   Recognise patterns in geographical data and deduce relationships
*   Compare and contrast different perspectives
*   Draw conclusions based on a reasoned consideration of evidence

  

**(iii) Synthesis and Evaluation**

*   Make well-substantiated and well-balanced evaluation.
*   Establish links and relationships between sub-topics/ themes/ concepts, and to demonstrate skill in producing a structured response  
*   **Formative assessment:** It aims to provide feedback on students’ learning and diagnose students’ needs, to help facilitate improvement. 
*   **Summative Assessment:** It is used for giving grades and measuring the overall learning of students against a given standards and informs and summarises what the students have learnt.
