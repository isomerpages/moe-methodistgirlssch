### Pedagogy

The syllabus will provide students with a balance of local, regional and international history spanning from the 13th to the 20th centuries. They will be interested to learn how the interplay of events and the people who shaped and implemented policies could have such a great impact on and changed the world to what it is today.  

  

Through an inquiry approach, the course requires students to think critically, analyse cause and effect, distinguish between fact and opinion, and view opinions from multiple perspectives.  They will have to make sense of different interpretations of the past, based on substantiated evidence, derived from a variety of sources such as video clips, newspaper articles, extracts from books, letters, speeches and statistics. In the process, students will be trained to be open-minded, perceptive, discerning and empathetic.

  

  

### Assessment

Through the course, students will be required to do a historical investigation (Lower Secondary), complete written assignments, authentic task including a self directed piece of coursework,  and oral presentation. These will require them to gather, organise, present information in a coherent manner, drawing similarities and differences, develop creative and critical thinking, evaluate and draw conclusions from the evidence that they gather.
