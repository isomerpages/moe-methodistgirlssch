<p>The MGS Secondary Handbell Ensemble was established in 1989 with the vision
of providing a platform for aspiring musicians to develop their interest
in music and nurture their creative talents in the performing arts.</p>
<p>We provide an opportunity for members with different musical abilities
to create music together. As part of the Handbell Ensemble, students are
exposed to music that spans a wide range of genres: be it sacred hymns,
classical pieces, pop songs, Disney or local songs. Through events such
as Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, the biannual Festival
of Arts and VIA events - all these aim to build teamwork, self-confidence,
self-esteem, resilience, respect and leadership in our students.</p>
<p>The Handbell Ensemble participates in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)
Arts Presentation and MGS Festival of Arts, often putting on combined concerts
with other musical groups in the school. There is also annual participation
in the schoolâ€™s Open House and Founder's Day Service.</p>
<p>Our CCA often has exchanges and collaborations with children and seniors
from Volunteer Welfare Organisations (VWOs), for VIA, enriching our members
to be more open-minded and accepting to people who are different from us.</p>
<p>Through these enjoyable and enriching opportunities, the students&nbsp;
are able to perform for meaningful causes and make a positive impact on
the lives of others. The Handbell Ensemble challenges members to step out
of their comfort zone and experience growth.</p>
