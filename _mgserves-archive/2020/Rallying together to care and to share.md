During this season of love and friendship, Primary and Secondary MGS girls came together to give back to the community through gestures of care and appreciation. 

On 14 February, they embraced the **MGS Wipe-Down** routine with enthusiasm, using paper towels and soap solutions to clean the canteen table surfaces after each recess.

Organized as part of the school’s Total Defence Day commemoration, the Wipe-Down encouraged MGS girls to take greater responsibility over their personal hygiene and to be socially responsible and considerate towards others who use the table after them.

The #MGSBlessings movement was also galvanised on this day to bring joy and comfort to Singapore’s healthcare workers on the frontline in the fight against Covid-19, through the annual **MGS Post-a-Blessing** . 

 
MGS girls penned their heartfelt gratitude towards our frontline healthcare workers in the hospitals across the country, as well as the staff at the Ministry of Health and various polyclinics, through colourfully decorated postcards. These cards conveyed their sincere well wishes and encouragement for the men and women working tirelessly to safeguard public health and care for those who are ill.

They also did not forget our own cleaners, security guards and staff at MGS, with cards thanking the ‘Aunties’ and ‘Uncles’ for ensuring that the school remains a clean and safe place for learning. 

It was heart-warming to see their collective spirit to honour and spur on these everyday heroes with the hand-written cards, which were sent to these everyday heroes after the Post-a-Blessing event.
