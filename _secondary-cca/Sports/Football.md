<p><a href="https://youtu.be/RuS6JeCgk7w" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Football</a> was
started by a group of like-minded girls and teachers in 2013. As interest
and commitment in the sport grew, Football became a full CCA in 2016.</p>
<p>The CCA aims to provide MGS girls who have an interest in Football with
the opportunity and pathway to grow and develop their passion and skills
in an inclusive and supportive environment.</p>
<p>MGS Football nurtures and grows its members to be confident and outstanding
young leaders who can work well with others, and who are resilient, determined
and fun-loving. Members not only develop their technical skills, but also
learn how to work as a team tactically. The student leaders, coaches and
teachers continually strengthen the team camaraderie to build lasting memories
and foster bonds between each individual member.</p>
