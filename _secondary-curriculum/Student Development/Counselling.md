Counsellors in MGS are passionate in providing a holistic approach to care and support our students.  We believe in a team effort to support and help our girls to be more aware of their emotions, strengths and weaknesses.  We aim to equip them with skills like emotional regulation and executive functioning to strengthen their capacities and personal effectiveness by enhancing their social, emotional and mental well-being.  

  

Through conversations with our counsellors, students have the opportunity to:

*   share with the School Counsellor concerns/ difficulties they might have,
*   receive support during difficult situations they might be going through,
*   learn and use strategies to manage and cope with their emotions or situations.

  

The MGS counselling team comprise our School Counsellor, ECG Counsellor, Allied Educator (Learning and Behavioural Support) as well as a team of trained Teacher-Counsellors to provide a safe environment for our students to share their challenges and work through their social, emotional, behavioural and mental health issues. 

Students who require **counselling support** may approach our School Counsellor, Ms Goh Chor Siang, at the counselling room located on level 1 (near the linkway) or email her at **goh_chor_siang@mgs.sch.edu.sg** for an appointment. Alternatively, students can approach their Form Teachers to assist in arranging the counselling session.  

  

For matters pertaining to **Special needs and learning support** , students may approach Ms Nimala, our Allied Educator (Learning and Behavioural Support) to get support for their learning needs. Ms Nimala’s office is also located on level 1 (near the linkway) or students may email her at **nimala_mokhna_rau@mgs.sch.edu.sg**.
