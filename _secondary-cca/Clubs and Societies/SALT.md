<p>SALT Club aims to help our members’ spiritual growth and enable them to
deepen their relationship with God. Members journey together through their
spiritual walk via worship sessions and Bible Studies. They also learn
to serve others through VIA activities.</p>
<p>Its philosophy is to bring God’s word to people we meet, by providing
opportunities for them to learn about Christ, and helping others to grow
spiritually in the likeness of Christ.</p>

<p>SALT Club provides a platform for members to grow spiritually and emotionally
by seeking solace in and being deep rooted in God’s word. The CCA also
develops members’ leadership competencies and skills as they organise worship
sessions, bible studies and VIA sessions. Through these sessions, SALT
Club inculcate values of respect, responsibility, care, empathy and humility
in its members.</p>
<p>The CCA emphasizes the importance of self-directedness and the manifestation
of the Fruit of the Spirit [Gal 5:22,23] among its members, and character
is honed by guiding members to take ownership of the running of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>CCA activities:</strong>&nbsp;Bible Study, Worship, Supporting
Discover Jesus Week, Love MG and VIA activities</p>
<p><strong>Community:</strong>&nbsp;VIA activities with Yew Tee Christian
Home</p>
<p>Through bible study sessions, members learn God's word and make applications
of God’s word in their daily lives. Through leading worship, members develop
confidence in standing in front of a group.</p>
<p>Each year, the CCA visits the Methodist Welfare Services Nursing Home
at Yew Tee to bring Chinese New Year cheer and joy to the residents. Members
put up performances and have meaningful interactions with the residents
at least twice in a year. The CCA also serves at the annual LoveMG event.
Through these, SALTies are able to bond and nurture their spiritual and
leadership growth.</p>
