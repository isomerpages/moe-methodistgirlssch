On Teachers’ Day, the entire primary cohort gathered together at the Indoor Sports Hall and we had a whale of a time. With the theme, “A Day in the Life of an MGS girl”, we kicked off the celebration with a “PE lesson” organised by the House Leaders. We then returned to our respective classrooms, where we had recess as a class and our Student Leaders conducted “lessons” for our teachers. As Prefects planning the celebrations, we had hoped for our teachers to experience what we usually go through on a regular school day - the fun and meaningful lessons. We wanted to show our appreciation to the teachers who have helped us come so far. Through this experience, we learnt to better communicate with our new Prefects and House Leaders, while leading the P3 to 6 class leaders to execute the “lessons” as well. All in all, this was a very unforgettable experience and a very good learning experience for all of us.

On 1 September, MGS held its annual Teachers’ Day celebrations, jointly organised by the Prefectorial and House Leadership Boards. This year’s concert bore the theme “One for the Ages”, which brought teachers on a nostalgic trip down memory lane. We followed two protagonists as they travelled back in time, witnessing the care that teachers in the past and present showed for their students.


Our teachers thoroughly enjoyed the various performances reminiscent of the ’70s and ’80s that were presented by our International and Indian Dance CCA. The highlight of the concert was also when our teachers and students battled against each other and went head-to-head in a nail-biting quiz on pop culture of the new millennium!

Filled with cheer, tears and laughter, Teachers’ Day 2022 was truly ‘one for the ages’!
