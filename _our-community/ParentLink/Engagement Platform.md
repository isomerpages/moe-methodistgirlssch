<h3>2024 ParentLink Event</h3>
<p><strong>ParentLink Engagement Platform</strong>
</p>
<p>The School and ParentLink collaborate as partners in supporting every
MGS girl in her growth journey of being and becoming her best self for
the world. Various opportunities are made possible for parents to contribute
to the development of their daughters during their school experience, thereby
strengthening the parent-daughter relationship. Parents can actively participate
by helping out in school programs, enrichment activities and learning journeys,
as well as engage in parent sessions and take part in parent-child bonding
activities. More information regarding these opportunities will be shared
at a later date. In addition, parents can also volunteer in the Library,
Reading Rocks and Circle of Care for Primary school, and the Worship and
Prayer parents under the School’s Christian Ministry. If you are interested
in volunteering for any of the above programmes, please email <a href="mailto:mgps@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>mgps@moe.edu.sg</u></a> (Pri)
or <a href="mailto:mgps@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>mgss@moe.edu.sg</u></a> (Sec)</p>

<h3>How you can help:</h3>
<p>Class reps form an important network through which ParentLink functions.
They are appointed based on indications of interest and recommendations
from level reps, ParentLink committee and/or teachers. Class reps are encouraged
to participate and engage other class parents to support ParentLink events,
offer/channel feedback and suggestions relevant to ParentLink, assist teachers/the
school when requested and initiate informal activities at class levels.</p>
<p>Should you be interested in helping in any of the events organized by
ParentLink, please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:mgss@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>email us</u></a>&nbsp;.</p>
<h3>Parents may also help in other areas:</h3>
<p>In addition, parents can also be involved with career talks and providing
work experience opportunities in the Secondary School, library duties in
the Primary School or be a part of regular prayer meetings to provide prayer
support to the school and girls as well as in ad-hoc events.</p>
