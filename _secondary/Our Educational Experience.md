At MGS, we hold firm the key tenets of the MGS education to nurture and develop girls in their journey of being and becoming Godly women of Excellence with a heart of Love. MGS aspires to be a purpose-driven values-centred community, committed to doing education with and not to our girls. Our desire is for our students to engage and make meaning of the world around them through continuous mastery and growth that prepares for a life of learning, leading and serving. As MGLearns, students embrace deep learning as culture and a way of life through a whole-of-school approach that develops the whole child, supported by teachers as key learning partners within a supportive learning ecosystem.  MGServes reflects our commitment to serve the community and, in serving, learn with and from the community. We are invested in coaching our students to be and become their best selves for our community, Singapore and the world, each embodying our school motto To Master, To Grow, To Serve today, for her life journey of tomorrow.
