Parent Volunteer (PV) Application
---------------------------------

The Parent Volunteer (PV) Scheme is applicable to parents whose children are Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents.  

MGS will only start taking in application one year before the student is due for P1 registration. For example, if your daughter is born in 2017, therefore going to P1 in 2024. The dates for P1 registration for children born in 2017 will be in 2023. We will take in PV application for that cohort in April 2022.

Please note that submission of the application form does not constitute acceptance as a PV by MGS. PV applicants will be evaluated and selected by the School Management after all the applications have been submitted. Please note that only successful applicants will be notified. 

The successful PV will start the service from July that year to June the following year and must complete at least 40 hours of volunteer work. Either one of the parents can contribute to the service during the volunteering period. Upon completion of the volunteering programme, the PV will be awarded with a certificate of completion which confirms the eligibility for Phase 2B registration.

You may also want to note that MGS, as with other Methodist Schools in Singapore, has a large body of Methodist member affiliates who are also eligible for priority registration under Phase 2B. Balloting will be conducted when the number of applicants exceeds the number of vacancies under Phase 2B. As such, being a PV will not guarantee a place for your daughter in MGS.
