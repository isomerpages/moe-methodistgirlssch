Started in 2015 to cater to girls with a passion for running - either sprints or longer distances, the CCA looks to continually improve and build upon its previous achievements. The collective experience of the rigorous physical training fosters positive, enduring memories and develops a strong bond among team members, which in turn nurtures their resilience, respect and sense of responsibility. The CCA’s structured comprehensive training programme provides everyone with the opportunity to reach their full potential.

Apart from the usual training sessions, Track seeks to develop its members holistically by exposing them to a diverse series of activities. These include workshops by prominent National SEA Games Athletes to refine the team’s technical skills, and to coach them on excelling in both studies and sports. Activities to foster teamwork, such as dragon boating, also strengthen ties between members. In line with the MGS motto (To Master. To Grow. To Serve), the team gives back to the community through initiating meaningful projects and helping out in fundraising.
