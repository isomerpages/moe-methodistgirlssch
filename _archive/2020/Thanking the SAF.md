To support the Whole-of-Government effort in fighting COVID-19 and encourage our Singapore Armed Forces to persevere on, MGS students from the Secondary school created posters appreciating SAF personnel for their role in mask packing, contact tracing and providing medical support to augment public healthcare systems. SAF personnel were also mobilised to set up temporary housing for foreign workers and assist operations at the dormitories. The studentsâ€™ artwork has brought cheer to the soldiers on the ground who have worked tirelessly for the nation.
