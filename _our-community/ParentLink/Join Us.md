### How you can help:

Class reps form an important network through which PL functions. They are appointed based on indications of interest and recommendations from level reps, PL committee and/or teachers. Class reps are encouraged to participate and engage other class parents to support PL events, offer/channel feedback and suggestions relevant to PL, assist teachers/the school when requested and initiate informal activities at class levels.  

Should you be interested in helping in any of the events organized by ParentLink, please&nbsp;[email us](mailto:mgss@moe.edu.sg)&nbsp;.

### Parents may also help in other areas:

In addition, parents can also be involved with career talks and providing work experience opportunities in the Secondary School, library duties in the Primary School or be a part of regular prayer meetings to provide prayer support to the school and girls as well as in ad-hoc events.
