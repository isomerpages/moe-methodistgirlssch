**Student Leadership**

The MGS Student Leadership Programme aims to prepare MGS students to serve as dynamic leaders in the 21st&nbsp;century. In line with the Ministry of Education’s Student Leadership Development (SLD) Programme, the School believes that every student can and should be developed as a leader and must be intentional in doing so.  
  

**Student Leadership Framework**

The MGS Student Leadership framework is built upon the school values of Godliness, Excellence and Love. Every MGS Student Leader is expected to be Godly, resilient and future-ready, possessing the 21st&nbsp;century competencies and exhibiting the desired student outcomes as identified by the Ministry of Education.

**Student Leadership Philosophy**

The MGS Student Leadership philosophy is ‘Every MGS Girl A Servant Leader’. MGS Student Leaders are encouraged to serve others while staying focused on achieving results that are in line with the School’s values. The training programmes are designed to develop servant leadership attributes of honesty, integrity, perseverance, modelling, visibility, pioneering and service in the Student Leaders. The MGS Student Leaders are expected to exhibit the behavioural traits associated with the servant leadership attributes.

**Student Leadership Development Plan**

The MGS Student Leadership Development Plan is a ten-year programme spanning Primary 1 to Secondary 4. The Plan trains students in leadership knowledge and skills and provides opportunities to apply what they have learnt.&nbsp;

There are two leadership training tracks in the MGS Student Leadership Development Plan:

1.  General Leadership
    
2.  Advanced Leadership
    

**General Leadership**

The General Leadership training targets all students from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 and for the Primary school, it is integrated into the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) curriculum. &nbsp;

**Advanced Leadership Programme**

Students who display strong leadership potential and a willingness to serve will also be selected to serve as in various student leadership roles:&nbsp;

*   Class Chairpersons (from P3 onwards)
    
*   Peer Support Leaders (from P4 onwards)
    
*   Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors (from P4 onwards)
    
*   Prefects (from P4 onwards)&nbsp;
    
*   House Leaders (from P4 onwards).
    
P1 and P2 students will also be provided opportunities to lead their class and peers in less formal and scoped roles (e.g. group leaders, class monitors per term). This will help them grow and gain confidence for roles as seniors in the school from P3 onwards.

**Discipline**

Guided by our vision of inculcating Godly women of Excellence with a heart of Love, self-discipline is one of the important virtues we hope to instil in our students to achieve excellence.&nbsp;

The minimum level of discipline expected from the students is clearly stated in the school diary and this is to help us ensure a safe and effective environment for teaching and learning. This includes proper use of school property and facilities, appropriate grooming and behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Any student found committing any offences (breaking of school rules) will be given demerit points. The student will be expected to show a change in behaviour and make any necessary corrections or amendments.
