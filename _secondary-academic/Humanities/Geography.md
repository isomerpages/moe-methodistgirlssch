<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>The broad goals of the subject were to develop both the cognitive and
affective domains. The curriculum provides students with spatial perspective
to physical and human phenomena and to equip them with a critical and analytical
mind to make connections to the real world.</p>
<p>Specifically, the goals of the curriculum are:</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop knowledge and understanding of Earth’s physical features and processes
and human phenomena.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate the interaction between people and environment at local, regional,
and global scales.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skills and Processes</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop skills in acquiring, communicating and applying geographical knowledge;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop multiple perspectives and global awareness through the study and
management of current issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equip students with inquiry skills of gathering and analysing information
in order to seek answers to issues affecting our lives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Values and Attitudes</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop respect and sensitivity towards the attitudes, values, and beliefs
of people in different human environments;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become self-directed learners who think critically and are discerning
in judgement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imbibes in students appropriate attitudes and values that ensures the
sustainability of our resources, people and planet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geographical Inquiry Process</h3>
<p>This curriculum is taught using the Geographical Inquiry Process which
promotes student-centred learning where students are actively engaged in
constructing geographical knowledge and engaged in learning experiences
that centre around geographical phenomena and issues.</p>
<p>There are 4 elements of the Geographical Inquiry Process that provide
guidance to the design of meaningful learning experiences for students:</p>
<p>a) Inquiry is question-driven: Inquiry questions create a need to know
and the process of seeking for answers is a means of constructing knowledge.</p>
<p>b) Inquiry is evidence-based: Students are equipped with skills to collect
data from primary and secondary sources, make sense of the data collected
and presenting them as evidence to support conclusions made</p>
<p>c) Inquiry involves sense-making: students develop conceptual understanding
in the subject matter and exercise sound reasoning to make sense of the
data they have gathered. Students think, perceive, and understand the world
through geographical concepts and lenses.</p>
<p>d) Inquiry involves reflective thinking: Students reflect on the conclusions,
judgements, viewpoints, and even actions they make when they address the
inquiry questions. Students can reflect on their choice of data sources,
methods of investigation, the extent to which the inquiry questions have
been answered by the students, and whether their conclusions have been
sufficiently supported by evidence.</p>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<h4>Assessment Objectives</h4>
<p><strong>(I) Knowledge and understanding</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Demonstrate relevant factual knowledge such as geographical facts, concepts,
processes, interactions and trends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select, organise and apply concepts, terms and facts learnt</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(II) Critical Analysis and Application</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Make judgements, recommendations and decisions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehend and extract relevant information from geographical data (numerical,
diagrammatic, pictorial and graphical forms)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use and apply geographical knowledge and understanding to interpret geographical
data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognise patterns in geographical data and deduce relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare and contrast different perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw conclusions based on a reasoned consideration of evidence</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(iii) Synthesis and Evaluation</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Make well-substantiated and well-balanced evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish links and relationships between sub-topics/ themes/ concepts,
and to demonstrate skill in producing a structured response&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Formative assessment:</strong>&nbsp;It aims to provide feedback
on students’ learning and diagnose students’ needs, to help facilitate
improvement.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Summative Assessment:</strong>&nbsp;It is used for giving grades
and measuring the overall learning of students against a given standards
and informs and summarises what the students have learnt.</p>
</li>
</ul>
