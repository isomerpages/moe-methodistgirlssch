The Girls’ Brigade Singapore started in 1927 at Methodist Girls’ School, and is an international uniformed youth organisation for girls.

  

The Mission of The Girls’ Brigade Singapore is to develop each girl and officer to her fullest potential by equipping. empowering and enabling ”Every Girl a Leader” and “Every Officer a Servant Leader”.

  

This is achieved through the fourfold programme of The Girls’ Brigade which aims to develop the spiritual, physical, educational and social domains of each member.

  

The weekly meeting programme encompasses worship, devotion, badgework/foot drill and recreational activities. There are also two camps in a year where students look forward to a time of fellowship and enrichment through activities such as amazing race, and learning leadership skills and values in authentic and fun ways.

Our members also participate actively in national events such as the Girls’ Brigade Friendship Day as well as the biennial Low Guat Tin Challenge and the National Drill Competitions. Selected members have the opportunity to march at the National Day Parade and participate in inter-uniformed group activities.

  

In 2021, 1st Company participated in the Dr Low Guat Tin Challenge 2021, the girls were tasked to create an entry related to the theme “Better Minds, Better Tomorrow”, aiming to foster deeper empathy concerning mental health. In the preparation for the competition, the girls had fun exploring creative ways to advocate for mental health. Our girls did the school proud, attaining 1 Bronze award, 3 Silver Awards, 3 Gold Awards, 1 Top of the Category Award and the Secondary Challenge Shield out of 556 entries from 1640 GB girls! To God be the Glory! 

  

Both the primary and secondary sections of 1st Company have also consistently achieved the Gold company award for more than 10 consecutive years.
