<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/OtluTcW0TyA" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MGS Bowling School Team</a> aims
to develop a team of dedicated and passionate bowlers who are interested
in developing and furthering their bowling skills and techniques to enable
them to participate in the various National Bowling Competitions over the
course of their secondary school education. Throughout their four years
in the team, our bowlers will undergo rigorous training sessions up to
3 times a week so that they will be equipped with the necessary bowling
competencies. The training sessions will help to nurture and develop bowlers
to maximise their fullest potential in the team sport. Bowlers will also
learn to work and bond as a team through various activities.</p>

<p>The MGS Bowling Team conducts weekly training sessions for its bowlers
to prepare them for the National School Games as well as other competitions.
This will include drills, video analysis, aiming, release, spares, strikes,
tactical adjustment, competitive observation, team roll-off and tournament
simulation.</p>
<p>School-based training sessions are also included to help build up the
bowlersâ€™ stamina and endurance, as well as foster closer ties between team
members.</p>
