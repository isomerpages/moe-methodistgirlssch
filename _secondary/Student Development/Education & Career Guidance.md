MGS Education and Career Guidance (ECG) seeks to nurture the future-ready MGS girl. The ECG team seeks to empower the MGS girl to identify their sense of purpose in life, encourage her to have a growth mindset, and to be adaptable and resilient to embrace the future opportunities and appreciate the value of all occupations.

The ECG curriculum will guide our students in:
* Discovering Purpose - Who am I?
* Exploring Opportunities - Where do I want to go?
* Staying Relevant - How do I get there?


Our MGS ECG site is regularly updated with upcoming events, and development of the Education and Industry landscape.
