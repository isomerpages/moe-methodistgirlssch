<p>The MGS Choir has a shared sense of passion and love for singing. The
Choir’s guiding principles are: Awareness, Attitude, Ability, Attendance.
We strive to inculcate self-discipline, independence, diligence and a sense
of shared responsibility in every chorister, and to be of service to our
school and wider community through our performances.</p>

<p>The Choir has benefited from yearly masterclasses from the likes of Professor
Gerald Wirth, President/Artistic Director of The Vienna Boys Choir, and
Ms Jennifer Tham, former MGS Choir Mistress and Cultural Medallion recipient.
Through these, we were able to gain deeper insights, understanding, and
a greater appreciation for singing.</p>
