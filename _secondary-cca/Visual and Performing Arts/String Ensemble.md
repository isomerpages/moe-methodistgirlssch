<p>The MGS String ensemble is dedicated to fostering a musical community
where everyone has a shared love for music. This is achieved by the strong
sense of pride and excellence within the CCA. Through public performances
such as the Istana (2024) and Esplanade Concourse (2022), as well as inter-school
collaborations with the Pui Ching Middle School and Taipei Philharmonic
Youth Ensemble (2023), the Ensemble has actively continually contributed
shared their music with the community.</p>
<p>The Ensemble also places a strong focus on giving back to the wider community.
As part of the school's Intergenerational Learning (IGL) programme, the
MGS String Ensemble mentored participants in a collaborative performance
during the 2024 Festival of Arts, Kizuna 1, at Victoria Concert Hall. This
initiative enabled students to foster deeper community connections through
music-making.</p>
<p>Beyond performance, the MGS String Ensemble encourages each member to
grow holistically, offering leadership roles in the Music and Administrative
Committees and creating opportunities for members to take charge of various
initiatives. These include organsing annual school exchanges with other
string ensembles, the March camp and CCA Fair, and helming in school performances
such as Founder's Day, Open House, and MGS Sunday. In addition, members
have the chance to arrange their own music for school performances, coordinate
mentoring clinics, and lead in chamber groups. Members are provided with
rich opportunities to expand their musical knowledge and refine their technical
skills, such as participation in String masterclasses and chamber music
competitions.</p>
<p>Through all these experiences, the MGS String Ensemble not only develops
the musical abilities of its members but also nurtures leadership, responsibility,
and a strong sense of community.</p>
