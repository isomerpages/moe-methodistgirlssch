It was a clear and sunny Tuesday morning. Students, staff and members of the MGS community gathered at the school field for a Thanksgiving Service for the Methodist Girls’ School Sports Complex (MGSSC). 

  

Bishop Dr Wee Boon Hup led the school in giving thanks and praying for God’s blessings and protection. 

  

Guests at the service were guided on a tour of the facilities of the MGSSC, a new facility which will be instrumental in developing generations of MGS girls into well-rounded ladies who embody the school values of Godliness, Excellence and Love.

We praise and thank God for watching over the building of our sports complex and affirm our dedication to nurturing and educating the young in heart, mind and body.

On Saturday 15 October, we welcomed prospective students and their parents to the MGS Open House. With the visitors eager to discover the MGS education, there was a buzz of excitement and energy in the school as they explored the distinctive programmes and myriad aspects of MGS life.   

  

Through the various exhibition booths, science experiments, micro-lessons, and CCA performances, the students and their parents got to experience firsthand the vibrancy of MGS on display. Indeed, the MGS heartbeat was truly felt as our student ambassadors and staff guided the visitors to ‘hear it’, ‘feel it’ and ‘live it’ through performances, hands-on sessions, briefings, tours and other activities planned.

Those who took the train to the Open House also enjoyed the showcase of MGS talent at King Albert Park MRT station with the MGS String Quartet and Guitar Ensemble performances and Sec 1 and 2 student artworks displayed.
