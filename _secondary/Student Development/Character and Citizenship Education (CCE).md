<h3>Overview</h3><p>In MGS, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integral to the holistic development of our students.

They are developmental in nature and revolve around Level Themes:</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><h4>Secondary / Year 1</h4></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Level Theme: Understanding Self</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>The focus is on helping students develop a deeper understanding of themselves as they transit into and navigate through their adolescent years. Students will gain an awareness of their personal strengths, learning styles, work habits as well as develop an understanding of the values that guide the personal decisions that they make. They will learn to take ownership of their lives and be responsible for their actions and also learn to be compassionate towards others, actively reaching out to touch the lives of those in the community.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><h4>Secondary / Year 2</h4></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Level Theme: Being a Team Player</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>The focus is on helping students develop skills and attitudes to become an effective and contributing team player.

Students will also learn to lead and take charge while respecting and showing consideration to others as they work collaboratively to make an impact on the lives of the less fortunate.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><h4>Secondary / Year 3</h4></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Level Theme: Becoming a Person of Influence</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>The focus is on helping students continue to strengthen their ability to build positive relationships with others as they assume roles of leadership in their class and CCAs.

Students will also learn to adopt a positive and proactive stance as they deepen their awareness and understanding of emerging local and global social issues.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><h4>Secondary / Year 4</h4></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Level Theme: Being Future-Ready</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>The focus is on helping students develop a strong set of values that will anchor their decision-making as they prepare to move on to the next chapter of their lives. Students continue to cultivate an attitude of perseverance, a teachable spirit and the passion and determination to give of their best in all that they do. They will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to allow them to continually seek opportunities to grow and develop. Furthermore, they will embark on a level project to bring love and cheer to the elderly in our community through the sharing of their time and talents. In doing so, be empowered to be advocates for the greater good.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>MGS Growth Journey</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Secondary/growth%20journey-01.png"></div><h3>MGS Milestone Programmes</h3><p>Enrichment activities or Milestone Programmes are organized for each cohort.
