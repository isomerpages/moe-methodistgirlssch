Welcome to the MGS family! The school's philosophy and the policy on Co-curricular Activities (CCA) are reflected in the school motto, “To Master, To Grow, To Serve,” which focuses on developing a self-motivated and well-balanced individual. The school strongly encourages all pupils to participate in at least one CCA for their benefit, both immediate and long term. Our co-curricular programmes support the holistic development of the pupils by providing opportunities for them to enhance their capacity in the psychomotor, cognitive and affective areas of their development. Active participation in a CCA allows the child to interact with her peers and others, and helps build confidence and self-esteem.
