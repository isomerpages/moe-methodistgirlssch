**Text for S1 Appeal (Before form is ready)**

The Secondary 1 appeal form will only be made available AFTER the S1 Posting is out on 22 December (to be confirmed) and the cut off scores for MGS O-track and MGS IP track for 2023 Sec 1 cohort are known. Any submission earlier than 22 December is pre-mature and incomplete.  
  
Please note that any appellant’s PSLE score should be within the school cut-off scores. We regret that we are unable to consider any appeals who do not meet the cut-off.  
  
Please access the [MOE website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/s1-posting/results/appeal-for-school-transfer) for further information and procedures.  
  
Note that only successful applicants will be notified.
