<p>Founded in 1887 by Miss Sophia Blackmore, our beloved school, Methodist
Girls’ School (MGS), is one of the very few schools in Singapore with such
a long illustrious history and heritage, and we recognise this as a privilege.
From Short Street to Mount Sophia and now at Blackmore Drive, MGS grew
from the initial enrolment of 9 girls to our current population of more
than 2600 girls, in both the primary and secondary sections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am blessed to be able to join the league of MGS headmistresses
with the honour to play a part to see our girls grow and develop into Godly
women of Excellence with a heart of Love to make a difference to the community
both in Singapore and the world through their continued journey To Master,
To Grow and To Serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As a Christian mission school, our Christian culture grounds our
girls in love, faith and hope to thrive and flourish with grace and strength.
Based on the principle “blessed to be a blessing”, you will find in MGS
an environment where the girls are nurtured and supported to strive to
do their best (MGLearns) while seizing opportunities to extend their gifts
and talents to benefit the wider and larger community (MGServes). Fundamental
to all we do, we are guided by our core values of Godliness, Excellence
and Love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The MGS girl is therefore given the opportunity to learn, grow and
become the best that she can be so that she can be of service and contribute
meaningfully and sensitively to others. When she leaves the gates of MGS,
she goes out confident and undaunted, well-positioned and ready to embrace
the dynamic world of the future. Indeed, over the years, we have many exemplars
among the thousands of alumnae who are women of substance and contributors
to society. That they continue to love and support their alma mater is
testament of the beautiful culture we have in MGS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The work to help the MGS girls develop and become young women of
character with a passion to serve others takes the entire MGS community
– staff and partners. Our partners include our supportive parents and alumnae,
the dedicated Christian ministry staff as well as many well-meaning and
generous community partners. We are thankful to each and are grateful to
have you as partners on this journey to provide our girls with a most enriching
and meaningful schooling experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To our current girls, know that here in our school, you are much
loved and supported. May God bless “Our school, the fairest in the land,
our own dear M.G.S.”&nbsp;</p>
