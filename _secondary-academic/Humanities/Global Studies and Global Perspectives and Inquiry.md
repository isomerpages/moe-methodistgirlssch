<p>Global Studies and Global Perspectives and Inquiry are offered as subjects
in the IP Programme.</p>
<h3>Aim</h3>
<p>The Global Perspectives and Inquiry programme aims to enable Sec 1 and
Sec 2 IP students to acquire knowledge and understanding of significant
events and issues from around the world while seeing that there are varied
perspectives that people have regarding related human actions and behaviours.</p>
<p>Global Studies is a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of political,
economic, social and cultural relationships of the world through the use
of various disciplinary lenses or perspectives. The essential disciplinary
content will also aid students’ understanding of their respective nation’s
(Singapore or otherwise) place within the global community and to prepare
them to be “glocal citizens” for an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<h3>Syllabus</h3>
<p>The syllabus has been created to be in alignment with the International
Baccalaureate Group 3 Subject Options. The issues and case studies are
related to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Business and Management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environmental Systems and Society</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geography</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global Politics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This course will lay the foundation for the Integrated Programme students
to take any of these subject options when they begin their studies for
the International Baccalaureate diploma.</p>
<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>The Global Studies (GS) curriculum is designed with the New Pedagogies
for Deep Learning (NPDL) in mind. The Global Competencies focused on are
Critical Thinking and Citizenship. The GS unit plans, with lesson activities
and assessments are planned in accordance to the NPDL Lesson Design framework
which comprises: Pedagogical Practices, Learning Partnerships, Learning
Environments and Leveraging Digital. The curriculum is also enhanced by
Lynn Erickson’s Concept-based Teaching and Learning. Unlike traditional
two-dimensional coverage models of facts and skills, Concept-based Teaching
(CbT) is a three-dimensional curriculum design model that frames the factual
content of GS with disciplinary concepts and generalizations. CbT is an
important enhancement to the UbD Framework because it emphasises on the
transferability of the enduring understandings, and at the same time highlights
the various disciplines behind the global issues through the use of discipline
concepts.</p>
<p>The GS curriculum is designed with an interdisciplinary backdrop. The
traditional disciplinarian baggage is alleviated as disciplines transcend
traditional subject boundaries or schools of thought, as new needs have
emerged in today’s increasingly globalised and complex world. The GS curriculum
provides students with these exciting opportunities to understand and attempt
to resolve global issues vis-à-vis interdisciplinary lens.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>The students will be assessed in a variety of modes besides the traditional
examination.</p>
<p>For GPI, the students will be assessed on their Critical Thinking and
Collaboration skills through their participation in a series of Community
of Inquiry discussions throughout the year. They will also be required
to write a self-reflection on the content and skills they have learnt.</p>
<p>In Global Studies, the students &nbsp;will have to complete one Authentic
Problem Task where they will be asked to write a research paper in a small
group. They will also tackle case studies where they will apply what they
have learnt about the concepts taught to analyse the case and form a point-of-view
about the issue / situation. There will also be other performance tasks
such as, oral presentations and quizzes.</p>
