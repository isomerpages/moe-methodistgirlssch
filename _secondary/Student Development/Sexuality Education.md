## MOE Sexuality Education in Schools

### Overview

Sexuality Education is a process of gaining knowledge and forming attitudes, beliefs and values regarding human sexuality.

MOE Sexuality Education covers the following areas:

*   Physical: Physical changes during sexual maturity.
    
*   Emotional: Sexual attitudes and feelings towards self and others.
    
*   Social: Sexual norms and behaviour, and the legal, cultural and societal implications.
    
*   Ethical: Values and moral systems related to sexuality.
    

The MOE Sexuality Education curriculum is holistic and secular. It is taught through:

*   Science lessons.
    
*   Character and Citizenship Education lessons in primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges and Millennia Institute.
    
*   eTeens programme in secondary schools, junior colleges and Millennia Institute.
    

It is taught in the context of mainstream national values, according to students' developmental needs. Our Sexuality Education curriculum is anchored on Singapore’s prevailing family values and social norms, which the majority of Singaporeans want to uphold. Marriage is defined as being a union between a man and a woman.

Sexuality Education emphasises the importance of respect for self and others, both online and offline, and respecting personal boundaries for healthy relationships and safety. It aims to help students develop positive self-identities and healthy relationships, and make responsible decisions on sexuality matters.

Sexuality Education in schools promotes abstinence before marriage, and teaches facts about contraception, consequences of casual sex, prevention of diseases, and how to say “no” to sexual advances. This also helps to reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases or teenage pregnancies.

Sexuality Education teaches students what homosexuality is and the importance of mutual understanding, respect and empathy for everyone.



### Why have Sexuality Education?

Our children are growing up with a wide range of influences through the media and the internet. Sexuality Education aims to:

*   Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.
    
*   Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.
    
*   Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.


### How is Sexuality Education delivered?

Sexuality Education is a combined effort which begins at home with parents, continues in schools with teachers, and is supplemented by community efforts.

The 6 guiding principles of MOE's Sexuality Education are:

*   Parents play the primary role in educating their children and are responsible for teaching and transmitting values on sex and sexuality.
    
*   Our educators will impart knowledge, skills and values that reflect Singapore's mainstream society so that students will make informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.
    
*   Aligned with our national values of encouraging heterosexual married couples to have healthy relationships with each other, and to build stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
    
*   Only specially selected and trained teachers will teach Sexuality Education in our schools.
    
*   Students and teachers are to respect the different attitudes, values and beliefs that different communities may have.
    
*   Relevant community resources that are aligned and approved by MOE may be used to supplement schools' programmes.

#### Sexuality Education Lessons:

The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his/her own identity and often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities (including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong, and hinder one’s ability to act responsibly. Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible consequences of sexual behaviour.
  
Through the Sexuality Education lessons, secondary students will have the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their character, and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality, which are of prime concern at this age.

**At Methodist Girls' School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in 2023:**

### eTeens Programme


eTeens  is a programme developed by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate information on STIs, HIV and protection from a health perspective. eTeens is conducted in two segments – a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme.

Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say “no” to sex and negative peer pressure. They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves their family. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages. The desired outcome of the eTeens programme is that students are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.



**At Methodist Girls' School, the eTeens programme will be implemented for Sec 3’s as follows in 2022:**
