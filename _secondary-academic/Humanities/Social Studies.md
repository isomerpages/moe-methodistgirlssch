<h3>National Syllabuses</h3><p>Please refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/courses/express/electives#subjects" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p><h3>Curriculum</h3><p>The syllabus is organised around two core ideas – “Being Rooted” and “Living Global”. Through these two ideas, the syllabus aims to develop our students into well-informed, responsible citizens with a sense of national identity and a global perspective.</p><p>The Social Studies syllabus content is organised around three Issues and is anchored in a set of Knowledge, Skills and Values Outcomes. The three Issues correspond to societal issues that have been shaping Singapore society and the world and were selected with these considerations in mind:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>The need to respond to the ‘new diversities’ in society</p></li><li><p>The need to strengthen the heart of an economically vibrant nation</p></li><li><p>The need to grow an informed, concerned and participative citizenry</p></li></ul><p>The aims of the syllabus are to enable students to:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>understand issues that affect the socio-economic development, the governance and the future of Singapore</p></li><li><p>learn from the experiences of other countries to build and sustain a politically viable, socially cohesive and economically vibrant Singapore</p></li><li><p>develop thinking and process skills which are essential for lifelong and independent learning have a deep sense of shared destiny and national identity</p></li><li><p>develop into citizens who have empathy towards others and will participate responsibly and sensibly in a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-religious society</p></li><li><p>develop into responsible citizens with a global perspective</p></li></ul><p>To achieve these aims, it is important that students develop competence in three areas: knowledge and understanding, skills and processes, values and attitudes. The specific abilities to be developed are:</p><p><strong>Knowledge and Understanding</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>to study the past through varied socio-cultural perspectives over time and space, and understand its relevance to the present through lessons learnt</p></li><li><p>to understand the structure of government and its functions in a contemporary society and recognise the importance of good governance and the roles and responsibilities of effective citizens</p></li><li><p>to understand the dynamics of living in a multi-ethnic environment and recognise the significance of social cohesion within a diverse society</p></li><li><p>to understand that the scarcity of resources affects the ways in which resources are allocated and managed, and recognise that informed decisions are made based on the choices available</p></li><li><p>to understand the global interconnectedness and interdependence among world societies and recognise the need to adapt to the changing world environment</p></li></ul><p><strong>Skills and Processes</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>to imbue students with the skills of critical enquiry, investigation and reflection</p></li><li><p>to develop critical and creative thinking in students. Critical thinking skills essentially refer to the skills of constructing explanation, and evaluating and interpreting information through making inferences, analysing evidence, comparing and contrasting views, and drawing well-reasoned and substantiated</p></li><li><p>conclusions. Creative thinking skills refer to identifying unique connections among ideas and suggesting insightful approaches to questions and issues</p></li><li><p>to develop students to be information-literate and adept in process skills so that they will be able to acquire, manage and use information creatively and effectively</p></li><li><p>to envisage possible and preferred futures and evaluate alternatives</p></li></ul><p><strong>Values and Attitudes</strong> to examine issues in society, locally and globally, so that students will:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>appreciate the implications of various decisions, actions and relationships</p></li><li><p>respect and value diverse perspectives and cultural and historical backgrounds of people, and work towards peaceful relationships</p></li><li><p>appreciate the importance of living in an interdependent community with increasing global connections</p></li><li><p>recognise the value of participating as ethical, active and informed citizens in a democratic society within a global community</p></li><li><p>experience and appreciate their ability to influence the present and the future</p></li></ul><h3>Pedagogy</h3><p>Students need a more active and authentic experience to make sense of and investigate societal issues through the process of inquiry. These issues are interdisciplinary in nature and usually drawn from the students’ experiences and society’s concerns.</p><p>Social Studies is taught using the Humanities Inquiry Approach, which is underpinned by four elements of inquiry, where learning should be Question-Driven and Evidence-Based, and involves Reflection and Knowledge Construction. These elements are further exemplified through students’ learning as they undergo the four stages of the inquiry process, which are Sparking Curiosity, Gathering Data, Exercising Reasoning and Reflective Thinking. Having a good understanding of these elements, the different stages of inquiry and strategies that facilitate these elements will lead to meaningful inquiry lessons for Social Studies.</p><h3>Assessment</h3><p>The assessment objectives are:</p><p><strong>Objective 1: Knowledge</strong></p><p>Candidates should be able to:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>demonstrate relevant factual knowledge</p></li></ul><p><strong>Objective 2: Constructing Explanations</strong></p><p>Candidates should be able to:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>demonstrate an understanding of concepts and terms appropriate to the syllabus</p></li><li><p>select, organise and apply the concepts, terms and facts learnt</p></li><li><p>make judgements, recommendations and decisions</p></li></ul><p><strong>Objective 3: Interpreting and Evaluating Sources/Given Information</strong></p><p>Candidates should be able to:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>comprehend and extract relevant information</p></li><li><p>draw references from given information</p></li><li><p>analyse and evaluate evidence</p></li><li><p>compare and contrast different views</p></li><li><p>distinguish between fact, opinion and judgement</p></li><li><p>recognise values and detect bias</p></li><li><p>draw conclusions based on reasoned consideration of evidence and arguments</p></li></ul><p></p>
