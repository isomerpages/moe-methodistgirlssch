Date: 11 August 2015

It all began with MG Week – 20 to 24 July – when the school celebrated MGS and affirmed the enthusiasm in building on its rich legacy. In 2015, we are mindful that MGS has been established for His Glory, and it is the school’s responsibility to persist in upholding all that MGS stands for.

MG Week saw the girls joyously engaged in a Splish Splash in the classroom, along the corridors, and in the common spaces; this was a timely reminder to always keep the campus clean and conducive for their learning. They also expressed their respect for members of the pioneer generation who continue to serve the school; and on Racial Harmony Day, they acknowledged, with considerable gratitude, the peace and harmony that they are privileged to enjoy. Parents added much to the learning by organizing a Food Fare which gave girls a taste of the various food from the different races in Multi-racial Singapore.

The celebrations escalated on Founder’s Day when MGS paid tribute to Ms Sophia Blackmore for her faith and passion in educating the girls in Singapore. At the Service on Friday 24 July, the Guest of Honour, Ms Ho Peng, who is Advisor to the Ministry of Education, expressed her appreciation for Miss Blackmore’s lasting legacy – “Today, women in Singapore can hold their own.  Equal opportunities exist for women because we have been blessed with access to good education….”  She was heartened that at MGS, “There is life, there is vigour, there is growth…” and we celebrate!

  

We celebrated on Youth Day, and sent representatives from Primary 4 and Secondary 2 to Youth Celebrate!, held on Sunday 26 July at the Sports Hub to showcase youth achievements in sports, the performing arts and the uniformed groups. The Prime Minister himself was present to celebrate Youth!

And on Thursday 6 August, the assembly area was a sea of red and white. We stood together to pledge, “We are Singapore, forever more!” We celebrated SG50; we heard the lion roar in jubilation, and together we proclaimed, Onward Singapore! Majulah Singapura!

### MGS@SEA Games 2015

Date: 29 June 2015

The 28th SEA Games was historic not just for Singapore but also for MGS. The biennial event took place in Singapore from Friday 5 June to Tuesday 16 June, and for many of the girls in MGS, it was a phenomenal experience.

Miya Yong (Sec 3H), Rayna Buckle (Sec 3H) and Tay Aik Fen (Sec 3R), members of the national team for synchronized swimming, completed 18 months of rigorous training, before they took to the pool to compete against other nations. And they won two Gold medals for Singapore. In fact it was the first time Singapore had secured Gold in Synchronised Swimming at the South-East Asian Games.  

Quah Jing Wen (Sec 3R) was in Spain in March to appreciate the demanding conditions of international competition, before she took the plunge in the Individual Medley event at the SEA Games, and won the Bronze medal; she did that with a personal best time too.

More than 250 girls in Secondary One, and Emily Ho (P3.1), Erica Lee (P3.2) and Ashley Jill Yeo (P5.1) gave up many a Saturday from February to June to prepare for their act in the Opening Ceremony. The Secondary One girls were in that visually spectacular Act 1, and the three girls from the Primary school were in Act 3. Although performing before 55000 spectators at the National Stadium was ‘nerve-wracking’, they were “all very grateful for this rare experience and privilege” to stand up for Singapore. 

The MGS Choir also found the huge crowd somewhat daunting, but they shared that “the support from family and friends really lifted our mood as we walked out onto the raised platform that sensational night.”  The Choir comprising girls from Primary Five, Secondary Two and Three, sang their hearts out to the audience, and cheered as loud as they could, “proud of Singapore and proud of MGS”. 

The experience of participating at the 28th SEA Games “was unbelievably glorious”, especially when you are a Singapore Girl!

### Singapore Women's Hall of Fame

Date: 27 March 2015

On Friday 27 March, the Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations (SCWO) commemorated International Women’s Day (IWD), and at the same time honoured the achievements of 11 women at a dinner at the Fullerton Hotel.  

The Singapore Women's Hall of Fame was launched last year and inductees in the inaugural ceremony included 14 MGS women of excellence such as Sophia Blackmore, Ruth Wong Hie King and Kwa Geok Choo.

This year, Mrs Ellice Handy was awarded a place in the Singapore Women’s Hall of Fame. A culinary pioneer and educator, Ellice Handy was born in 1902 and her entire life was associated with Methodist Girls’ School (MGS). She wrote the first Singaporean cookbook, My Favourite Recipes, which was first published in 1952 and reflected Singapore’s multicultural heritage.

Ellice entered MGS when she was four and spent almost all of her student and working life at the school. After getting her Bachelor of Arts degree in india, she returned to MGS in 1922 as a teacher. In 1945 she became its first Asian principal and had to restart the school after the ravages of World War ll. She wrote her cookbook to raise funds for MGS and it soon became a culinary reference book in many households. In 1957, she was conferred the Order of the British Empire for her work in education. She moved to live with her daughter in Australia when she was 85 and died of a stroke two years later.

The current edition of [My Favourite Recipes](https://mgs.moe.edu.sg/about-us/the-mgs-store) is available for purchase at MGS at $50 for a copy. Part of the proceeds from the sale of this book will go towards the building of the Integrated Sports Complex. A treasured tome and acclaimed classic, the cookbook has been the subject of many reprints and editions. It captures the nostalgic times of British colonial kitchens and tropical rubber plantations through quintessential Singapore and Malaysian dishes of a past era.

On 21 November 2014 and 12 January 2015, our Primary 6 cohort and Secondary 4 girls of 2014 received their results for the PSLE and GCE O Level. It is with joyful hearts of thanksgiving and praise to God that MGS has achieved yet again!

We celebrate the efforts and hard work of all teachers, parents and girls for the stellar results in both the PSLE and GCE O Levels.

We praise and thank God for His blessings and for having watched over our girls as they embarked on these milestones in their education. We are grateful for the many supportive parents who have prayed tirelessly and contributed towards Project Care for the Secondary 4s and at recess times during the PSLE.
