During these tumultuous times of upheaval and flux, sometimes we need to take pause and reflect amidst the maelstrom of events and information as we grapple worldwide with the changing landscape. 

  

Technological advancements have immense impact on the way we work and play. Before COVID-19 triggered lifestyle adjustments for each and every one of us, technology has already been powering the changes in our daily lives as we make new discoveries and adapt to unfamiliar systems and platforms. Technology is a worldwide societal revolution and it creates much food for thought.

  

It is hence fitting that this year’s King Albert Park MRT Station (DT6) artworks by MGS Secondary 1 and 2 students, guided by their teachers, feature the role of technology in society. 

  

The art piece Reimagining: Artist & Technology uses ink and pencil illustrative skills and a monochromatic palette to form mythical and surreal commentaries on the interwoven roles of social media and technology in our lives.


Pixel Perfect: Artist & Technology is a colourful expression of how we interact with and utilise technology to shape our connected world.


The art displays by our MGS budding artists have presented the community with thoughtful contemplation during their commutes. Do visit the King Albert Park MRT Station if you are in the vicinity to lend your support!
