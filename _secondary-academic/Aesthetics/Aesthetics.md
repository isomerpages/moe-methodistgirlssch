<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>The Aesthetics in MGS - Visual Arts, Food and Consumer Education and Music,&nbsp;
aims to nurture our students to learn in, about and through the arts by
enabling deep learning experiences where competencies in Communication,
Creativity and Collaboration play pivotal roles.&nbsp; Students develop
emerging 21st Century Competencies with communication skills in designing
for the audience and creating impact, creativity in pursuing and expressing
novel ideas and solutions with their artistic expressions and by working
interdependently with others as leaders and team players. Our subject disciplines
and curriculum design collectively shape values and knowledge for students
to learn purposefully and serve others in meaningful ways.</p>
