The CCA develops (1) computer language coding, (2) still and moving image capture through the use of drones, still and movie modes in our cameras and (3) sound management skills and competencies through a thoroughly thought out four-year programme, and imparts values of respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity, care and harmony for each other and the community we are in. Each member will choose to specialise in either coding or image and sound capture.

While learning skills and competencies for themselves, our members exercise and hone these in service to the community by assisting in various school events throughout the year.

Members who choose to specialise in coding will learn coding skills for various purposes such as aiding people with daily tasks, as well as, designing and coding various types of computer games. The graduation project for the members as part of the four year programme will require them to plan and conduct a workshop for their juniors in the school.

  

Members who choose to specialise in imaging and sound capture will learn basic camera handling skills and various photography / videography techniques. The members will also have the opportunity to conduct training workshops for students in other schools. The members will hone their skills and techniques through event photography / videography capture of school events.

  

Members will take part in various coding and imaging competitions organised by external agencies. All members are expected to participate in these competitions to gauge their standards / levels of achievement. Values-In-Action activities are initiated by the members who will choose the area in which they wish to return to the community.

Our members have won awards in various competitions over the years.
