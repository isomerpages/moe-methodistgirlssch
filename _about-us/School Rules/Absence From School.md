Students are expected to attend all classes and school activities organized for them. Failing to do so without valid reasons will constitute truancy. 

  

Any absence from school must be covered by a medical certificate or parent’s letter.

  

### Absence From Assessment (Tests and Examinations)

A zero mark will be given for the missed test/examination without a valid reason. Valid reasons are:

*   A valid medical certificate
*   Approved representation in an inter-school or national competition

  

### Prolonged Absence from School during Term Time

Permission must be sought from the Principal should there be an extenuating reason for a prolonged period of absence during term time. This should be done through an email from parents/guardians stating reason(s) for absence.

 
The Principal reserves the right to grant/deny permission for absence from school.
