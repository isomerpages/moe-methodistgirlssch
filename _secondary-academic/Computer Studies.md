<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>At MGS, our Computer Studies curriculum aims to empower students with
critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity; equipping our
students with the resilience and adaptability to navigate the complexities
of tomorrow's technological landscape.</p>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>Computer Studies at MGS is not merely about preparing students for the
future, but empowering them to shape it. We recognise the transformative
power of computing in the fourth industrial revolution. As technology advances
and Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities grow, computing subjects
serve as a gateway for students to explore the frontiers of innovation.
Our Computing program is tailored to nurture talented or passionate students
who may aspire to pursue computing-related studies or careers in the future.
The curriculum prepares our students for diverse fields and careers in
the digital age, by:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developing computational thinking skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fostering a culture of creativity and innovation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instilling principles of digital literacy, cybersecurity, and ethical
behaviour</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through a dynamic and holistic educational experience, we aspire to ignite
a passion for lifelong learning, emboldening our students to embrace uncertainty,
embrace challenges, and seize opportunities as they emerge in the digital
age</p>
<p><strong><u>Pedagogy</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Moreover, our curriculum transcends the mere acquisition of technical
skills; it fosters the emerging 21st century competencies such as critical,
adaptive and inventive thinking, as well as collaboration.&nbsp; Through
hands-on projects and collaborative endeavours, students are encouraged
to think critically, solve complex problems, and unleash their imagination
to devise innovative solutions to real-world challenges.</p>
<p><strong><u>Curriculum Framework</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The design of our Computer Studies is guided by the MOE Computing Curriculum
Framework which was revised in 2017.</p>
