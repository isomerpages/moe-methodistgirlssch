### Vision

The MGS Computer Studies Curriculum is to help students to develop 3 important skills that are critical as they navigate the ever-changing landscape:  

1.  critical thinking, 
2.  problem solving; and
3.  creativity

Our students will be learning coding which is an essential skill in the future because it is an important part of the digital transformation. Especially with the unprecedented disruption from Covid-19, we see an increasing number of jobs that require coding skills as most services and products are being digitized.

  

### Curriculum

By the end of the 2nd year in MGS, all students should have the following outcomes:  

1.  Robotics Secondary/Year 1 students shall be able to use Scratch to create programmes and BBC Micro:Bit for building robots with functional purposes.  
2.  Code4Life Secondary/Year 2 students shall be be able to use Python programming language to create programmes and Generative Art

Lessons for each class is once every fortnight for 1 hour 50 min.

  

### Assessment

While Computer Studies is a non-examinable subject, students will be assessed based on their assignments and projects.
