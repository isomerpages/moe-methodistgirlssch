**Please note that payment of fees is on a quarterly basis.**

### (A) Fees payment through Interbank GIRO

With effect from 1 January 2020, MGS will be using GIRO for all school fees and miscellaneous fees collection. Fees will be processed automatically through GIRO on the 8th of the month except for Term 1. If the 8th of the month of deduction falls on a weekend or public holiday, the deduction would be made on the following working day. The deduction dates are illustrated as follows:

*subject to change

Please note that this GIRO arrangement is not extended to cover your child’s/ward’s payment for enrichment programmes and other school charges.

### (B) Fees payment for Term 1 :

The [Interbank GIRO Application Form (Appendix 1)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-NA2hyQirvFf_r-02vIokoCPg-9vDVdD/view?usp=sharing) can be obtained from the School’s Finance Office or the School’s website. You may use any of your bank accounts for GIRO deduction.  

Please submit the duly completed and signed Interbank GIRO Application Form to the School’s Finance Office. Any amendment to the GIRO Application Form has to be countersigned and the use of correction tape is not allowed on the form. Please do not set any deduction limit.  

The fees for January, February and March 2022 will be deducted once the bank accepts the GIRO arrangement, tentatively on 28 January 2022 (for Secondary 2 to 4) or 25 February 2022 (for Secondary 1). An official invoice will be emailed to you informing you of the deduction date and amount.

Please maintain sufficient funds for deduction on the dates stipulated in the above table. If deduction fails due to insufficient funds, a reminder will be issued to you for a second GIRO deduction. There will be an administrative charge of **$30** , and this continues to be imposed for every reminder sent until payment is received.  

Please note that in line with the government’s ongoing Smart Nation initiative where achieving a cashless economy is one of the current focus areas, the school has ceased to accept cash for all school charges (i.e. school fees, miscellaneous fees, enrichment programme and others) with effect from 1 July 2020.

### (C) Change in Citizenship and Withdrawal from School 

In the event where your child/ward acquires Singapore Citizenship or Singapore Permanent Resident status, please write to the class form teacher and School’s Finance Office together with a copy of documentation proof, such as NRIC or Passport. Please note that the monthly fees applicable to new Citizenship status will only be effective the following month.

If you are withdrawing your child/ward from school, please write to the Principal officially at least one month in advance. Please note that there will be no refund of school and miscellaneous fees once deducted or paid. 

### (D) Use of Edusave Pupil’s Fund to Pay Enrichment Programme charges (applicable to Singaporean Only)

The Edusave Pupil’s Fund can be used by your child/ward to pay for enrichment programme charges. Please complete the enclosed Standing Order Form (Appendix 2) and submit it to the School’s Finance Office by **Friday, 7 January 2022** , so as to provide the School with your consent to deduct your child/ward’s Edusave Pupil’s Fund. 

### (E) Payment Schedule

We have included the payment schedule below for your information.
