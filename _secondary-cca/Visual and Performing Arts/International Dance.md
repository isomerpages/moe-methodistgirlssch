<p>International Dance Club is dedicated to continuously pushing boundaries
and grooming the finest dancers. Beyond the biennial SYF Arts Presentation
and annual participation in the school’s Open House and Teachers’ Day Celebrations,
the CCA’s signature biennial Dance Night is the hallmark of each member’s
co-curricular experience. It is a time of bringing forth their best choreography
pieces together with their alumni, and reaching out to the wider audience
through dance. There are also various opportunities for external performances
to connect to the community and learn from others.</p>
