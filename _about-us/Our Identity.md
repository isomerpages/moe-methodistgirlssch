### School Values

<table class="tg">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="tr-header">GODLINESS<br>
        Being anchored by a greater purpose that directs one’s beliefs, thoughts and actions.</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="tr-norm"><p><em>“Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives’ tales; rather, train yourself to be godly.  For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance. That is why we labour and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all people,  and especially of those who believe.”</em></p>
        <p>1 Timothy 4:7-10 [NIV]</p>
        <p>Being Godly requires training and is important  for this life and beyond. </p></td>

    <tr>
      <td class="tr-norm"><p><em>One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” <br>
          Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God  with all your heart and with all your soul and  with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbour as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” </em></p>
        <p>Matthew 22:35-40 [NIV]</p>
        <p>Being Godly means connecting our heart, soul and mind to a greater purpose, to God. </p>

Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. <br> Love never fails.” </em></p>
        <p>1 Corinthians 13: 1-8 [NIV]</p>
        <p>Being loving is the most important gift and achievement.</p>

## School Crest

The change in the school crest was initiated by the Principal Miss Lau Meau Eng (1957-1972) as the old badge in enamel could only be made in England.

The crest was introduced in 1965, but there is no record of who designed it.


## School Song

With loving hearts and joyous song we sing to M.G.S. <br>
And tell the fame of that fair name for we can do no less. <br>
We hope that we may honour bring, and heaven ever bless <br>
Our school, the fairest in the land, our own dear M.G.S.

Down through the years our memories will keep a loving place <br>
For friendships made and pleasures shared, and lessons learned apace. <br>
For those who worked and gave their best that we might learn to face <br>
The trials of life with faith and hope and nobly run the race.

And now we're proud to raise the shout and sing of M.G.S. <br>
Lift high her banner, one and all, her name we now profess. <br>
In work and play for honours won, today our hearts confess <br>
The debt we owe, the love we hold for our dear M.G.S.

## BLESS THIS SCHOOL

['Bless This School'](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L41AyMuvFF0gVZPPpHLrB5u5OHsI5iIQ/preview)  is a familiar song that reverberates throughout the school campus daily, and distinctively characterises the schooling days of all MGS girls. Refreshed in 2022, it marks the 135th founding anniversary of MGS, and was first performed live at the MGS 135th Founder's Day Service & Graduation Ceremony.

## MG Houses

The MGS House system was first formed in 1932, with four houses named after Methodist pioneers in Singapore: Blackmore, Oldham, Shellabear and Horley. They were later renamed **Blackmore , Olson , Lee and Jackson** .
