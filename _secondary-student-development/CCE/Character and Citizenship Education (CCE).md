## Overview


In MGS, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integral to the holistic development of our students. Through the various lessons and activities in the CCE Curriculum, we seek to develop a **positive school culture** that nurtures the **future-ready MGS Girl**.   

  

#### (A) A positive school culture in MGS 

*   is supported by a peer support framework
*   is steered by strong teacher-student relationships where students are recognised and affirmed for their positive actions and contributions  
    
*   adopts a Culture of Honour in our interactions with one another
*   recognises that CCE is a shared responsibility where mutual collaboration and sense of ownership are strong among staff and students

  

#### (B) The future-ready MGS girl

*   is anchored in values
*   is hardworking and resilient  
    
*   is equipped with knowledge, skills and attitudes to navigate the unknown future
*   adopts a spirit of continuous learning
*   is a socially responsible citizen, who contributes positively to family and community

  

## Curriculum


The CCE Curriculum is anchored on the school values of Godliness, Excellence and Love. It is delivered through lessons conducted during curriculum time (GEL lessons, Assembly period, Chapel and Daily Devotions), enrichment activities and informal interactions with staff.

  

The topics that are discussed during GEL lessons, our in-house programme that combines aspects of Character and Citizenship Education, and assembly lessons include:

*   Character and Citizenship Education Lessons (customised based on MOE curriculum)
*   Life Skills including personality profiling and study and time management skills
*   Leadership Skills
*   Education and Career Guidance
*   Sexuality Education
*   Cyberwellness 
*   Citizenship Education
*   Values in Action

Lessons and activities in the CCE Curriculum are selected and customised for the MGS girl as she progresses through each phase of her schooling years. They are developmental in nature and revolve around Level Themes:

## MGS Milestone Programmes

Enrichment activities or Milestone Programmes are organized for each cohort. These activities provide authentic contexts for learning as well as opportunities for students to practice the social-emotional skills they have learnt in class. Activities are designed for social mixing and communication where through common tasks and challenges, students take steps forward to interact with those beyond their class and school.

  

The milestone programmes for each level are as follows:

  

**Secondary/Year 1**

*   ROCs 1 : Adventure Camp
*   Orientation Programme

**Secondary/Year 2**

*   ROCs 2 : Road Less Travelled Learning Journeys

**Secondary/Year 3**

*   ROCs 3 : MOE-OBS Challenge Camp

**Secondary/Year 4**

*   ROCs 4 : Careers Festival
*   Longest Day
*   Baccalaureate Service

  

  

## School Experiences


The MGS girl is presented with a plethora of experiences and opportunities for growth, socialisation and self-discovery. These are offered both at each stage of their schooling years and as the opportunities arise. These are optional and we encourage students to take up some of these offers to fuel an existing interest, learn something new, discover new knowledge, practice planning and leadership, forge friendships and make memories.

  

The experiences include:

*   Self-initiated VIA projects
*   WoW Space activities
*   STEAM programme activities
*   Friend of Singa Ambassador
*   House activities
*   Sec 2 Immersion programme
*   Sec 3 Overseas VIA trips
*   Sec 3 Work Experience
*   Sec 3 Regional Youth Conference (Biennial)
