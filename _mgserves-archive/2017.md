### MGS Carnival

**Saturday 1 July 2017 – it was Carnival time at MGS!**

It was the day the MGS community came together to enjoy a reunion with friends and family, to make more friends and have lots of fun, all in support of the MGS Sports Complex. It was the day for which members of ParentLink had worked tirelessly and for months;  they took charge of the logistics and every detail,  and it was certainly a day to remember!  

There was a strong sense of ownership at the Carnival; every girl, every teacher, every parent, every alumna played a part in making the Carnival a success in more ways than one. The enthusiasm was everywhere in Blackmore Drive, and the Carnival experience was not just a learning opportunity, but also a chance for building relationships, team-spirit, and the community. 

The girls readily shared that they learnt much about being responsible, working together, "stepping up" when necessary, and how to cope with uncertainty in promoting their wares. And a teacher affirmed, "The Carnival made me see a different side of my students.. the workers and the responsible ones…..  A precious lesson… beyond the textbooks."

MGS was blessed with fantastic weather; indeed God Almighty was watching over the Carnival and all whose dedication to the cause was heartfelt. To God be the Glory!

### Post-a-blessing

Date: 17 February 2017

Organised as a part of the #mgsblessings movement, the Post-A-Blessing project was held in partnership with SingPost to acquaint our girls with crafting hand-written postcards and provide them with the opportunity to personally design and post a card to their loved ones, friends or anyone they would like to encourage.

### MGS Sports Complex

At MGS we have a new Sports Complex, a 21st century sports hub which provides greater and convenient access to a range of sports and recreational facilities; for sure, it encourages our girls to pursue excellence and realise their dreams.
