<p>The Girls’ Brigade Singapore started in 1927 at Methodist Girls’ School,
and is an international uniformed youth organisation for girls.</p>
<p>The Mission of The Girls’ Brigade Singapore is to develop each girl and
officer to her fullest potential by equipping. empowering and enabling
”Every Girl a Leader” and “Every Officer a Servant Leader”.</p>
<p>This is achieved through the fourfold programme of The Girls’ Brigade
which aims to develop the spiritual, physical, educational and social domains
of each member.</p>
<p>The weekly meeting programme encompasses worship, devotion, badgework/foot
drill and recreational activities. There are also two camps in a year where
students look forward to a time of fellowship and enrichment through activities
such as amazing race, and learning leadership skills and values in authentic
and fun ways.</p>
