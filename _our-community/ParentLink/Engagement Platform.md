<h3><strong>ParentLink Engagement Platform</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The School and ParentLink collaborate as partners in supporting every
MGS girl in her growth journey of being and becoming her best self for
the world. Various opportunities are made possible for parents to contribute
to the development of their daughters during their school experience, thereby
strengthening the parent-daughter relationship. Parents can actively participate
by:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>taking on the role of Class reps in the Primary School,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>helping out in school programs, enrichment activities and learning journeys,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being involved with career talks and providing work experience opportunities
in the Secondary School,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>volunteering in the avenues such as Library, Reading Rocks and Circle
of Care for Primary School,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>serving in Worship and Prayer parents under the School’s Christian Ministry,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engaging in parent sessions and taking part in parent-child bonding activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Primary School, Class reps form an important network through which
ParentLink functions. Class reps are encouraged to participate and engage
other class parents to support ParentLink events, offer/channel feedback
and suggestions relevant to ParentLink, assist teachers/the school when
requested and initiate informal activities at class levels.</p>
<p>The following outlines some of the parent engagement platforms and activities
