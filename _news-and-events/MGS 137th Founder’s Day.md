<h4>WE ARE MGS</h4>
<p>Featuring the diverse faces and voices of our beloved MGS family, this
video co-created by Sec 2 students celebrates the rich tapestry of our
school in commemoration of MGS 137th Founder's Day. As part of their Learning
Unboxed programme, our students honed their digital storytelling and video
production skills, bringing to life the connections and experiences that
define us. Join us in celebrating our shared heritage and the incredible
spirit of our community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
