The biennial Methodist Girls’ School (MGS) Regional Youth Conference (RYC) is a conference for young adults aged 15 to 18 years old seeking to engage with some of the complex issues we face today. As global citizens of today and global leaders of tomorrow, these young adults need to be empowered to make a decisive difference in this rapidly changing world which they will inherit.

RYC aims to be the premier platform where students from Singapore and the region get to interact with experts from the public sector, academia as well as the private sector to learn and exchange ideas. By encouraging student delegates to raise awareness and gain a deeper understanding of the complexity of these issues, we seek to nurture a spirit of innovation and resilience in our youth. 2018 represents a key milestone in the history of the Conference as this is our tenth iteration. 

[Here are the themes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR_9YHNFuR_to6bcA3Eibjrw8y6boN-0eDBUhieSjtkXZtAdeqZU39RjzpiB3QGaLH1Nch-Ur_BKaAA/pub) our Conference has addressed over the past years.

RYC is suspended for the time being.
