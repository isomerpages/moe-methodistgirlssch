<h2>MGS Awards and Scholarships 2024</h2>
<p>Methodist Girls’ School&nbsp; invites our students to apply for the following
Awards and Scholarships in 2024:</p>
<p><strong>(I) Puan Sri Helene Tan Chin Tuan Scholarships</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(II) Jumabhoy Impact Award&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(III) Tommy Koh Award for Arts and Creativity</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The criteria for all MGS awards have been aligned to reflect our belief
in recognising a broader definition of success. We believe that success
should not be defined by marks, grades, accolades and achievements, but
by one's service and contribution.&nbsp; We want to encourage our students
to make a difference to positively impact the community, nation and world
around them.</p>
<p>It is important that all awardees are of good character,&nbsp; role modelling
our MGS values and motto. Our values and motto are articulated on our MGS
website, which you can find at the following <a href="https://www.mgs.moe.edu.sg/about-us/our-identity/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>
