<p>The MGS Physical Education curriculum strives to develop our studentsâ€™
physical, psychomotor, emotional, cognitive, psychosocial as well as spiritual
domains through a systematic programme of appropriate learning experience.
The programme also aims to promote a greater appreciation of healthy living
and a more positive attitude towards physical activities.</p>
<h3>Aims</h3>

Literacy, Global Awareness &amp; Cross-Cultural Skills; Critical &amp;
Inventive Thinking; Communication, Collaboration &amp; Information Skills)
and the 6 Global Competencies (Critical Thinking, Creativity, Character,
