n July, the P1.2 students learnt about Singapore’s parliamentary elections from their teacher, Mrs Tse Nan Shing.

  

MGS was both a nomination centre and polling centre for the 2020 General Elections, and it was an opportune time for the girls to learn about the election process.

  

Even though they are 14 years away from the age where they get to vote in an election, the girls enjoyed creating a self-drawn worksheet encapsulating the 3 things they have learnt, 2 values that they look for in Members of Parliament (MPs) and their 1 piece of advice for them.

  

Eager to share about their lesson, the girls wrote a letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong^ which described how they carried out their very own ‘‘election’ to select 7 leaders in one SMC and three 2-member GRCs, and even counted the ballot papers! They recounted how it was exciting but at the same time, scary to go to the polls, and had wise reflections on not being elected.

To the surprise of P1.2, PM Lee wrote back to express his delight on their efforts to learn about the elections, and encouraged them to stay interested in what is happening and to contribute to Singapore in their own ways.


We look forward to our little ones growing up into young women with the zeal to make positive change and a giving heart to contribute to society, wherever they may be.
