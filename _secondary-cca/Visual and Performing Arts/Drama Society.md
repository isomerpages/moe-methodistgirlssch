In Physical Theatre and Film Production, the senior members learn the elements of physical theatre and how to write a production play script. The sessions help develop an area of expertise based on students’ own interests and teach them to apply the skills they have learnt.

At the end of every year, Drama Society offers an accreditation opportunity for all Secondary 1-3 members with the Trinity College London Examinations as part of our enrichment programme. The examinations are designed to encourage candidates from all countries and cultures to engage with as wide a variety of performance activities and materials as possible while developing their skills within an integrated framework of assessment. They also offer candidates opportunities to demonstrate performance skills appropriate to their interests and aspirations.
