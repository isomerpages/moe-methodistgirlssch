Supported by the Women’s Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in America, Miss Blackmore, an Australian missionary, came to Singapore with a mission – to provide girls with an education.</p><p>Miss Blackmore started the school with nine girls in a shophouse along Short Street, Their fathers who were Tamil businessmen, donated money and furniture which allowed the rent-free shophouse to become the Tamil Girls’ School, forerunner of Methodist Girls’ School. The school soon attracted other girls and in 1891 it temporarily relocated to Middle Road while a larger building was constructed on the Short Street premises to house 150 students.</p><p>10 years later, the first Senior class of four girls sat for and passed the Cambridge Examination. The enrolment at MGS continued to increase steadily, and by 1925 the school had to move to Mount Sophia. Due to the continued increase in numbers, the school moved again in 1992 to its present Blackmore Drive campus.</p><p>In 1989, MGS Secondary acquired independent status and thereafter the full school functioned in a single session. In 1997, the Secondary school started the Integrated Programme (IP) leading to the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) at Anglo-Chinese School (Independent). This added pathway alongside the existing O Level programme, has enriched the MGS learning experience and provided different options to the students.</p><p>Today, MGS continues to nurture Godly women of Excellence with a heart of Love so that they can make a difference to the community, to Singapore and the world through their continued journey To Master, To Grow and To Serve.</p><p><strong>Unless the LORD builds the house, they labour in vain who build it; Unless the LORD guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain. Psalm 127:1</strong></p><h2>School Song</h2><p>With loving hearts and joyous song we sing to M.G.S. <br>And tell the fame of that fair name for we can do no less. <br>We hope that we may honour bring, and heaven ever bless <br>Our school, the fairest in the land, our own dear M.G.S.</p><p>Down through the years our memories will keep a loving place <br>For friendships made and pleasures shared, and lessons learned apace. <br>For those who worked and gave their best that we might learn to face <br>The trials of life with faith and hope and nobly run the race.</p><p>And now we're proud to raise the shout and sing of M.G.S. <br>Lift high her banner, one and all, her name we now profess. <br>In work and play for honours won, today our hearts confess <br>The debt we owe, the love we hold for our dear M.G.S.</p><h2>BLESS THIS SCHOOL</h2><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L41AyMuvFF0gVZPPpHLrB5u5OHsI5iIQ/preview" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">'Bless This School'</a> is a familiar song that reverberates throughout the school campus daily, and distinctively characterises the schooling days of all MGS girls. Refreshed in 2022, it marks the 135th founding anniversary of MGS, and was first performed live at the MGS 135th Founder's Day Service &amp; Graduation Ceremony. <br></p><h2>To MGS</h2><p><strong>Words &amp; Music by Eleanor Wong, Class of 1978</strong></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3D_sSvatwQc?si=ymKRhxN8W8UKMUpc"></iframe></div><p>Mama would chide at breakfast time as I pocketed my money for the day.<br>You be a good girl now you hear, and always remember that you are to say,<br>Good morning to your teachers,<br>And be nice to your friends.<br>If you ever do wrong (God forbid)<br>just make sure that you make amends.</p><p>Cos you're a student in a special school<br>Where the girls are sweet &amp; heed the golden rule<br>So always behave at your very best<br>Cos you're Special<br>You're in MGS<br>You're in MGS!</p><p>Eyes are all bleary early morn,<br>midnight oil is still just burning in my head<br>But a test is coming and I'm thinking of<br>The many many times that Mama said,<br>Study hard for each subject, just do well all through the year<br>And you'll never have to worry<br>When report book season is here</p><p>Cos you're a student in a special school<br>Where the girls study hard and never play the fool<br>So aim high, high in every test<br>Cos you're special<br>You're in MGS<br>You're in MGS!</p><p>I wake her up though it's only dawn.<br>She makes a face and rubs her eyes.<br>Then she gives me a grin minus one front tooth<br>And a thousand memories arise,<br>Of good old days as a teenage girl,<br>Of fun-filled hours of happiness.<br>And I watch from the gate as she boards the bus,<br>Look after her, dear MGS</p><p>Cos she's a student in a very special school,<br>where the girls study hard, they heed the golden rule,<br>And her Mama knows that she's getting all the best,<br>In that special school<br>That's called MGS<br>She's in MGS</p>
