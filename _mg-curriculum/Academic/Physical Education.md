### Vision:

Every girl to be physically literate, in pursuit of excellence and a healthy lifestyle

### Our Philosophy:

We believe a high quality Health &amp; Physical Education curriculum is an integral part of every girl’s total education in MGS, covering physical, social, emotional and cognitive development of a child.

It is the goal of the Health &amp; Physical Education department to inspire our girls to be physically active and maintain a healthy lifestyle through:

1.  acquisition of fundamental movement skills, knowledge, competence and attitude to participate and excel in a wide range of physical activities
2.  provision of broad-based and balanced programmes for enjoyment and competitive sports to excel in

  

### A physically educated MGS girl is able to:

*   move competently and confidently in a wide range of physical activities
*   take responsibility for her personal health and fitness
*   exhibit positive personal-social character traits such as resilience, fair play, respect and sportsmanship when participating in physical activities

  

### Key Level Programmes
