<p>Every MGS student strives to Master, Grow and Serve in every phase of her life. The Student Development Department aims to provide a holistic and integrated programme which will enhance the social, emotional, intellectual, moral and spiritual growth for all MGS students in order that they may be morally upright, responsible and resilient MGS girls who are well-respected and able to contribute to society beyond MGS.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="MGS Student Development Diagram" src="/images/Secondary/Student%20Development.png"></div><p></p>
