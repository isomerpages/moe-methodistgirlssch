<p>The CCA develops (1) computer language coding, (2) still and moving image
capture through the use of drones, still and movie modes in our cameras
and (3) sound management skills and competencies through a thoroughly thought
out four-year programme, and imparts values of respect, responsibility,
resilience, integrity, care and harmony for each other and the community
we are in. Each member will choose to specialise in either coding or image
and sound capture.</p>
<p>While learning skills and competencies for themselves, our members exercise
and hone these in service to the community by assisting in various school
events throughout the year.</p>

and coding various types of computer games. The graduation project for
the members as part of the four year programme will require them to plan
and conduct a workshop for their juniors in the school.</p>
<p>Members who choose to specialise in imaging and sound capture will learn
basic camera handling skills and various photography / videography techniques.
The members will also have the opportunity to conduct training workshops
for students in other schools. The members will hone their skills and techniques
through event photography / videography capture of school events.</p>
<p>Members will take part in various coding and imaging competitions organised
by external agencies. All members are expected to participate in these
competitions to gauge their standards / levels of achievement. Values-In-Action
activities are initiated by the members who will choose the area in which
they wish to return to the community.</p>
