### Secondary 1

The ESIS are awarded to Singaporean students who are in the top one-third of the total number of Secondary 1 students admitted to all IS, based on PSLE results (before bonus points).

Students who meet the ESIS cut-off score and are admitted to IS under the Direct School Admission Exercise will also be offered the ESIS.

The ESIS award quantum of the award is $2,400 per year, or the annual school fees charged by the IS less the annual amount of school and standard miscellaneous fees paid by students in government/ government-aided schools, whichever is lower.

For students awarded ESIS, and are also recipients of the Independent School Bursary (ISB), the ESIS award quantum is $2,400 per year, or the annual school fees less the school fee subsidy provided under ISB, whichever is lower.
