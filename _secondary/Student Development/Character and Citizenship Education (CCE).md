<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In MGS, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integral to the holistic
development of our students. Through the various lessons and activities
in the CCE Curriculum, we seek to establish a <strong>caring and enabling school culture</strong> and
develop <strong>values and social-emotional competencies</strong> in our
students.</p>

<p>The focus is on helping students develop a deeper understanding of themselves
as they transit into and navigate through their adolescent years. Students
will gain an awareness of their personal strengths, learning styles, work
habits as well as develop an understanding of the values that guide the
personal decisions that they make. Through a variety of student development
experiences, students learn about the importance of qualities such as honesty,
respect, empathy, and responsibility. They also explore the concept of
citizenship, understanding their rights, privileges, and responsibilities
as members of their school, local community, and broader society. By fostering
a sense of belonging and encouraging active participation in civic life,
we aim to empower our students to become ethical, compassionate, and socially
responsible individuals who contribute positively to the world around them.</p>

<p>The focus is on helping students develop skills and attitudes to become
an effective and contributing team player. Students will learn to build
positive relationships with others through exploring the core elements
needed in strong relationships as well as deepening their understanding
of their own strengths and weaknesses when working in teams. Students also
learn to effectively communicate their ideas, actively listen to others,
and work together towards common goals. They develop an understanding of
the value of diverse perspectives and learn to navigate conflicts constructively.
By nurturing a culture of collaboration and open communication, we prepare
our students to thrive in environments that require teamwork, adaptability,
and effective interpersonal skills.</p>

<p>The focus is on helping students continue to strengthen their ability
to build positive relationships with others as they assume roles of leadership
in their class and CCAs. Through their various learning experiences, students
are encouraged to question assumptions, and explore innovative solutions
to complex issues as they work together in teams to tackle projects that
address local and global issues. Central to this approach is the cultivation
of empathy, as students learn to understand and appreciate diverse perspectives,
recognizing the impact of their actions on others. By empowering students
to become empathetic changemakers, we equip them with the tools and mindset
needed to make a positive difference in their communities and beyond.</p>

<p>The focus is on equipping students with the competencies necessary to

learning and reflective practices, students are encouraged to develop a
strong sense of personal integrity, ethical leadership, and social responsibility.
Moreover, students continue to foster effective communication skills, including
verbal, written, and digital literacy, essential for navigating diverse
professional and social landscapes. By emphasizing character development
alongside citizenship and communication, we aim to empower students to
become conscientious global citizens who can adapt to change, lead with
integrity, and contribute positively to society in meaningful ways.</p>

to fuel an existing interest, learn something new, discover new knowledge,
practice planning and leadership, forge friendships and make memories.</p>
