THE MGS IP aims to develop and nurture Godly Women of Excellence with a Heart of Love: inquiring, knowledgeable, principled and caring young women who respect others and help to create a peaceful and better world. Aligned to these imperatives, the inclusive environment promotes collaboration and sharing of different perspectives.
