The Club was started in 2017 when the swimming pool was built. The dedicated and enthusiastic members participate in CCA sessions regularly, building strong bonds and improving their swimming skills at the same time.

The Club programme aims to motivate, inspire and develop students’ passion in swimming through improved stroke techniques, and development of stamina and speed to participate in intra- and inter-school competitions. Members are also introduced to water survival skills and assist in water therapy sessions for special needs children. In so doing, they play a valuable part in being a blessing to others.

In furthering the MGS swimming legacy, each member is given the opportunity to achieve her full potential in leadership, competitive experience and service to the community.
