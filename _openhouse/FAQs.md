## DSA

### 1. What documents do I need to submit together with the application form?

Application will be online via MOE's DSA-Sec Portal. During this stage, there is no need to submit any documents yet.

Only shortlisted applicants need to submit them upon request by schools.


### 2. I am posted to another school through my DSA options but I am keen to appeal for a place in MGS. Am I allowed to appeal?

As a DSA student, you are **not allowed** to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results as you are expected to honour your commitment to your posted DSA school, for the duration of the programme that you are admitted into.

More info at [https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/direct-admissions/dsa-sec/overview](https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/direct-admissions/dsa-sec/overview)

### 3. My child has been offered a place in DSA, does she still need to make an option for the Sec schools?"

If your child has been confirmed a place in DSA or given a waitlist in DSA at the DSA Sec exercise, and is posted to MGS, she will not be given an option form to select secondary schools.

However, she needs to complete her registration to her posted secondary school. Please check school websites for registration details.

### When will I know if I have been shortlisted for the test / audition / trial / interview?

All applicants will be informed if they have been shortlisted for e-conferencing and be provided with further details, at the end of June.

### When will I know if I have been offered a place?

All shortlisted applicants will be notified of the outcome of their applications by end of August 2021.

### I received more than one DSA offer. When must I decide which to accept?

You will have to indicate your preferences in ranked order for up to three schools during the Exercise School Preference Stage in late October after PSLE.

### What is the minimum score needed to be shortlisted for DSA trial / audition?

The DSA scheme provides students to gain admission to a DSA school via talent area(s). All applicants will be assessed on their talents and ability to cope with the school curriculum.

### Must my child’s PSLE Score fall within a specific range even if she receives a Confirmed Offer from your school?

For MGS, your child must qualify for the Express stream.

### Where can I find the list of CCAs for DSA 2021? Is it the same as the 2020 list found in the website?

The new list of DSA Talent Areas for DSA 2021 will be put up after MOE’s release of DSA information.

### Is there a DSA quota for each CCA or on the whole?

There is no fixed quota. The objective of DSA is to identify talent, taking into consideration the student’s interest and long term development potential.

### Are there CCAs which are more popular and see a higher number of DSA applicants?

No, there is no discernible trend.

### If my child gets in through DSA, must my child join the CCA for 4 years? What if her interest changes?"

Yes, your child is obliged to contribute in that DSA CCA and hence must remain in the same CCA so that we can develop her full potential over four years.

If choice of CCA is important, then your child should avoid applying for entry via DSA Sports or Music as the above conditions apply.

### Would my daughter be at a disadvantage during the DSA exercise if she is not a Singaporean?

Your child’s nationality does not matter in the DSA exercise. Our assessment is based on talents and ability to cope with the rigour of the school curriculum.
