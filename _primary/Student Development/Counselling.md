Counselling is an opportunity for students to:

*   share with the School Counsellor concerns/difficulties they might have,
    
*   receive support during difficult situations they might be going through,
    
*   find solutions to their problems, if necessary.
    

  

School Counsellors are trained to help students with their difficulties. There are also trained Teacher-Counsellors to support students who may feel more comfortable speaking to a teacher.

### Why see a School Counsellor?

Students may experience situations that are difficult to cope with.  Having support can be helpful. These could be:

- Problems with friendships (e.g. making friends, perceptions of bullying)

- Problems at school (e.g. not coping with school tasks)

- Problems at home with siblings and/or parents

- Problems with grief/loss, anxiety, stress, learning, etc.

###How can I get in touch with our School Counsellor?

*   Students and parents may request to do so: 
	*  Through their teachers 
    * Through a hardcopy form at the School General Office

*   Students can also use the [MGS student website](https://sites.google.com/mgs.sch.edu.sg/mgpri/get-in-touch?authuser=0) under “Get in touch”
*   Teachers may also make a referral directly to the School Counsellor, if deemed necessary.
