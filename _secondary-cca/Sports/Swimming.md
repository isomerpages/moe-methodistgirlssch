<p>The Club was started in 2017 when the swimming pool was built. The dedicated
and enthusiastic members participate in CCA sessions regularly, building
strong bonds and improving their swimming skills at the same time.</p>
<p>The Club programme aims to motivate, inspire and develop studentsâ€™ passion
in swimming through improved stroke techniques, and development of stamina
and speed to participate in intra- and inter-school competitions. Members
are also introduced to water survival skills and assist in water therapy
sessions for special needs children. In so doing, they play a valuable
part in being a blessing to others.</p>
<p>In furthering the MGS swimming legacy, each member is given the opportunity
to achieve her full potential in leadership, competitive experience and
service to the community.</p>
