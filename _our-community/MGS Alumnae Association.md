<p>The MGS Alumnae Association serves as a bridge between the Old Girls and
the School. As the Alumnae, we are the custodians of our rich heritage:
we encourage one another to strive to being and becoming Godly women of
Excellence with a heart of Love, and uphold our motto: To Master, To Grow,
To Serve, wherever we are placed and in every phase of our lives.</p>
