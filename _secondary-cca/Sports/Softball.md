Softball is a team sport that can be characterised as a game of strength, grit and power. It is a limited-contact sport where every member has a crucial part to play. The rigorous four-year programme allows players to advance through different age-group teams, as well as participate in annual competitions organised by various external partners. In addition to developing basic sports skills and competencies, the CCA aims to impart the values of self-discipline, resilience and sportsmanship, all of which are crucial to ensuring game flow and success.

  

Students can expect fun yet challenging training sessions which incorporate both theory and game situations to hone basic softball skills such as throwing, catching, fielding, pitching, batting and base-running. Given each player’s unique strengths and talents, every softball player will adopt roles that best suit their competencies.

Players can also look forward to participating in various events such as the annual National School Games and Singapore Recreation Club’s softball carnival, as well as highly anticipated school camps. While the intensity and frequency of training sessions and competitions demand a high level of commitment, they form an integral part of the team’s journey to their podium target in the National School Games, as evidenced by our ‘B’ Division’s defending championship title since 2017.
