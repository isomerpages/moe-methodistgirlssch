MGS does not restrict the education of its girls to the confines of the classroom or of Singapore. While the school has ventured out cautiously in the past, today it provides innumerable opportunities for the girls to experience life and learning further afield. The girls journey to places like Malaysia, India, China, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Eastern Europe and the United Kingdom on educational trips, on immersion or twinning programmes and on service-learning programmes. The world, indeed, is their oyster.  

Since 2006, the Sec 1, 2, 3 and 4 classes have embarked on a learning journey of their lifetime. Reality Outside Classrooms (ROCs) is a relevant, rigorous and responsive global education that seeks to meet the challenges of connecting our young with their peers and adults in different cultures, different learning environments. In the course of the four academic years in secondary school, the girls embark on the Road to Discovery (Year 1), on the Road Less Travelled (Year 2), then on the Highway to the World (Year 3) before Taking Flight (Year 4). Beyond the classroom, they cultivate a better understanding of the region in Asia and the world across the oceans. They travelled the world and without exception, they found an exciting new perspective of the diversity of culture and of themselves in the global village.

### Sec 3: ROCs 3 Highway to the World (World)

The MGS ROCs 3 (Reality Outside Classrooms) Programme is a milestone programme for the Secondary 3 cohort. The school customises programmes to prepare our students for life and work beyond MGS.  

The objectives of ROCs 3 are as follows:
1. To be engaged in impactful learning experiences outside the classroom setting. This includes intentional and incidental teachable moments for leadership, independence, interdependence, communication and social skills.
2. To experience positive growth and gain confidence through problem-solving and risk-taking situations and through guided activities that may seem beyond their physical and mental abilities.
3. To develop from authentic contexts, the 21C competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills that build the cultural sensitivities and broaden perspectives of the world they live in. To be sensitized to the place of Singapore in the region and the world as they appreciate and develop a respect for social, cultural and religious diversity.
4. To learn through meaningful service the application of their own ideas, talents and academic content to improve the well-being of local communities. Through activities that meet the needs of others, they learn ownership and pro-activeness in implementing innovative and purposeful solutions.   
5. To ensure that the programmes meet the above objectives, students will be brought through thought-provoking reflections during daily debriefing sessions. Through these session, they will learn to share experiences which enable a shared sense of achievement and an enhanced sense of self-identity.
