Regular Independent Learning Days (ILDs) is integrated into the schooling experience of Secondary school students. ILD aims to develop students’ ability to be self-directed, passionate and lifelong learners. To achieve these intended outcomes, ILD days in MGS are held once every fortnight.
 

ILDs will comprise:

a. **Curriculum coverage**. 2-4 hours of largely asynchronous learning. Students can plan and manage their learning at a suitable pace for themselves.

b. **Student-initiated Learning (SIL)**. Dedicated time (at least 2-3 hrs) for students to explore interests and learn outside the curriculum. These learning activities can be fully student-initiated or selected from a list of school-curated learning activities. Students are encouraged to explore the three areas of ICT, Well-being and Academia, and to document their growth journey in their MGS Passport.
