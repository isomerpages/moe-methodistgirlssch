<p>The MGS Alumnae Association serves as a bridge between the Old Girls and the School. As the Alumnae, we are the custodians of our rich heritage: we encourage one another to strive to being and becoming Godly women of Excellence with a heart of Love, and uphold our motto: To Master, To Grow, To Serve, wherever we are placed and in every phase of our lives.</p><p><a href="https://www.mgsalumnae.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Click to access the Alumnae site.</a></p>
