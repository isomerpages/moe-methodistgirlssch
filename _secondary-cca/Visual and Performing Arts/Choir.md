The MGS Choir has a shared sense of passion and love for singing. The Choir’s guiding principles are: Awareness, Attitude, Ability, Attendance. We strive to inculcate self-discipline, independence, diligence and a sense of shared responsibility in every chorister, and to be of service to our school and wider community through our performances.

The Choir has benefited from yearly masterclasses from the likes of Professor Gerald Wirth, President/Artistic Director of The Vienna Boys Choir, and Ms Jennifer Tham, former MGS Choir Mistress and Cultural Medallion recipient. Through these, we were able to gain deeper insights, understanding, and a greater appreciation for singing.
