Students gain exposure to music that spans a wide range of genres: sacred hymns, classical pieces, pop songs, Disney or local songs. Through events such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, the biennial MGS Performing Arts Night as well as VIA activities, members build teamwork, self-confidence, self-esteem, resilience, respect and leadership while honing their musical skills.</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="100%" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSw7f8pOfVxd0FHoVCbk-DcIh-MR8jrC31SCQ64aJCtZMiy4207GiA7g3kf2NxYy9XVJNOWLMJ5sM6s/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p>The Handbell Ensemble&nbsp;participates in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation and MGS Performing Arts Night, a biennial event. The CCA also features in the MGS Festival of Arts, and comes together with other musical groups in the school for combined concerts.</p><p>Members have exchanges and collaborate with the community, such as other schools and Volunteer Welfare Organisations (VWOs) for VIA, enriching their learning. Through these opportunities, members are able to perform for and contribute towards meaningful causes to positively impact the lives of others. The Handbell Ensemble&nbsp;challenges members to step out of their comfort zone to grow and realise their potential.</p><p>Every year, the Handbell Ensemble&nbsp;offers an accreditation opportunity to all Secondary 1-4 members with the London College of Music (LCM) Handbell Ensemble Level 5 Examination Certification. The examination is designed to encourage students to develop their musical skills within an integrated framework of assessment.</p><p><strong>2023 Performance and Achievements:</strong> <br></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation – Distinction</p></li><li><p>Methodist Schools’ Long Service Award Service 2023</p></li></ul><p><strong>2022 Performance and Achievements:</strong>&nbsp;<br></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Methodist Girls’ School Festival of Arts I (a digital Arts Production): Ikigai</p></li></ul><p><strong>2021 Performance and Achievements:</strong>&nbsp; <br></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation - Distinction</p></li><li><p>Methodist Girls’ School Performing Arts Night (a digital Arts Production): Chikara</p></li></ul><p><strong>2020 Performances and Activities:</strong> <br></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Cajon workshop</p></li></ul><p><strong>2019 Performance and Achievements:</strong> <br></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation - Distinction <br></p></li><li><p>Methodist Girls’ School Performing Arts Night: Confidi in Dio <br></p></li><li><p>London College of Music (LCM) Handbell Ensemble Level 5 - Certificate of Distinction <br></p></li><li><p>Extraordinary People (EPL) Concert @ National University Singapore Culture Centre</p></li></ul><h2>Leadership Opportunities</h2><p>**President / Vice-President: **</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Organise and take charge of self-practice sessions together</p></li><li><p>Coach and develop the juniors in the Handbell committee in their leadership skills</p></li><li><p>Mentor and guide the various committee i/cs</p></li></ul><p><strong>Secretary/ Assistant Secretary:</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Oversee administrative duties</p></li><li><p>Record minutes for Handbell Committee meetings</p></li><li><p>Prepare articles for school publications</p></li></ul><p><strong>Logistics and Assistant Logistics i/c:</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Oversee Handbell instruments and scores</p></li><li><p>Assist teachers to update and maintain the Handbell stock inventory / records.</p></li><li><p>Plan the layout for every performance</p></li></ul><p><strong>Treasurer and Welfare i/c:</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Manage finance matters</p></li><li><p>Organise and plan the New Members Welcome Party</p></li><li><p>Organise bonding activities / game / self-initiated VIA for Handbell members</p></li></ul><p><strong>Training Group Leaders and Assistant Training Group Leader:</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Develop the members’ passion for Handbell ringing</p></li><li><p>Train and lead the self-practice sessions</p></li><li><p>Do note assignments</p></li><li><p>Work with the Instructor and teachers on the weekly training program</p></li></ul><h2>CCA Schedule</h2><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Days: Monday &amp; Wednesday</p></li><li><p>Time: 4.00 - 6.30pm &amp; 3.00 - 6.15pm</p></li><li><p>Venue: Secondary Dance Studio</p></li></ul><p></p>
