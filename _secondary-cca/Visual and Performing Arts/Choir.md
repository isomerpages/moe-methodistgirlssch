<p>We are a group of girls who have a shared passion and love for singing.
Our guiding principles are: Awareness, Attitude, Ability, Attendance. We
strive to inculcate self-discipline, independence, diligence and a sense
of shared responsibility in every chorister, and to be of service to our
school and wider community through our performances.</p>

<p>Each year, we participate in various events, from internal events such
as our school’s biennial Festival of the Arts, our school’s Founder’s Day
service and National Day celebrations to external events such as the National
Day Celebrations at Gardens by the Bay, Makan Sedap Fellowship 2024 and
the Attorney-General's Chambers National Day Observance Ceremony amongst
others.</p>

<p>A highlight for us in 2025 is our participation in the SYF where we attained
a Certificate of Distinction. We were also privileged to present a song
offering with soloist and ex-Choir alumna Lauren Yeo at the ‘The Healing
Nation’ Celebratory concert for the 140th Celebration of the Methodist
Church in Singapore.</p>
<p>All these opportunities have contributed to our learning by fostering
collaboration, character development, and creativity. Through small group
and whole choir performances, we have gained skills of teamwork and adaptability
as we work together in harmony. This collaboration with peers, conductors,
and external partners have enhanced our ability to communicate effectively
and appreciate diverse talents within a team.</p>
