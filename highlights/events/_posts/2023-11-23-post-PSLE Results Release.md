Dear Parent/Guardian, 

Thank you for considering MGS as one of the secondary schools for your daughter. Please refrain from purchasing any personal learning device for your child's use in school. We have scheduled a Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) Zoom Parent Engagement session on Wednesday, December 27, 2023, at 5 pm. During this session, Mr. Kenneth Soh, HOD Educational Technology, will provide more information about the purchase of your child's school-prescribed Personal Learning Device. Details for accessing the Zoom session will be shared via Parents Gateway closer to the date. Thank you.
