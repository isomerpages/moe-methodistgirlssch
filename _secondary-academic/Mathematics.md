<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>To develop logical and critical thinkers who are competent in using mathematical
reasoning, communication&nbsp;and problem solving skills in real world
contexts.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>To provide a varied and authentic learning experience for our students,
promoting interest and confidence in Mathematics.</p>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>The learning of mathematics involves exploration, analysis and presentation
of math patterns and relations both&nbsp;within the subject and across
other disciplines. It is not just an academic subject, but an important
vehicle that &nbsp;stretches the girls’ minds and promotes critical and
analytical thinking.</p>

<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>Our curriculum enables our girls to acquire problem solving skills and
engages them through a variety of&nbsp;learning experiences to appreciate
the relevance, usefulness and connectedness of the subject to both&nbsp;real-world
context and other disciplines.</p>
<p>It enables our girls to :</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>build a solid secondary mathematics foundation in preparation of higher
level mathematical studies and supports other disciplines such as Sciences,
Engineering and Economics in higher institutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>see and experience the beauty and practicability of mathematics in relation
to the real-life environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and demonstrate their understanding of logical thinking and creative
problem solving skills</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>A balance of formative and summative assessments comprise of&nbsp;</p>
