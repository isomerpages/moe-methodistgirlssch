The MGS Choir has a shared sense of passion and love for singing. The Choir’s guiding principles are: Awareness, Attitude, Ability, Attendance. We strive to inculcate self-discipline, independence, diligence and a sense of shared responsibility in every chorister, and to be of service to our school and wider community through our performances.
